Youâ€™ve got an important job interview today, and you need to shave your beard for it, but all the mirrors in your house mysteriously shattered!

Carefully guide your VR razor across your face, and attempt to make yourself look presentable without using a mirror.

When you arrive at your job interview, you will be graded by your interviewer on how appropriate you look.
