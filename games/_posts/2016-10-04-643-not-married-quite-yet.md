A game that you give to your significant other to play that is secretly a way to figure out what their ring size is without asking them directly.

This game would be masked as some sort of simple quiz or short interactive experience.  Give it to your spouse and the game will subtly ask what their ring finger size is, amongst other semi-related things, so as not to be too suspicious.  The data (well, just the ring size) is then emailed to the original partner.
