Put your entire iTunes or music library on shuffle, and hit play. If you can guess the songâ€™s Artist, you gain a point.  If you know the Song Name, add another point, and another for the Album Name, for a total possible 3 points.  If you can guess any of these three things within the first few seconds of the song, you automatically get all 3 of those possible points.  You start the game with 1 point. If you drop below 0, you lose.  You can set any number as a goal to reach, such as 20 or 40. 

It can also be fun to play this game without the points system!
