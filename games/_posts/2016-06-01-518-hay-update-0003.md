Kevin and I have decided that we’re officially pausing development of *Underground* (temporarily, don’t worry!), to focus on our strategy game, *Hay*.  The decision was made almost exclusively because *Hay* will be quicker and simpler to develop for us (and we’re also **very** excited about the game design!).

Below you’ll see some of Kevin’s first renderings of one of the game pieces, Pig! He’s adorable and we can’t wait to animate him and see him in action.
