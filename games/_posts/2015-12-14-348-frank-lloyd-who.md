In this game, you’re a well-known carpenter contractor, and it’s your job to interpret the (sometimes unclear) will of your clients into beautifully designed rooms.

Like *Animal Crossing* meets *The Sims* meets working with clients in real life, this game has you receiving requests from clients of all types and personalities.  You have to spend time with them and have a conversation with them to best understand what it is they want designed and how.  After your discussion, it’s up to you to best interpret what they said into a design that will suit their needs and match their style.  More difficult clients will give you less or more vague information, or will sometimes feature a couple or group of people, each with their differing opinions on it, some of which will need to be (correctly!) sacrificed for the greater good of the design.

(Thanks Madeleine!)
