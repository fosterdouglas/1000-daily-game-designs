We’ve got a v2 of the flow map set up for [Dicey](http://sandcastle.co/dicey){:target="_blank"}.  

It’s still going to need some updating, but it’s much more refined from the [previous version](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/228-dicey-update-04/){:target="_blank"}.

Below is a preview, but [click here](/downloads/dicey_ui_flow3.pdf "Dicey UI PDF3"){:target="_blank"} to see the full .PDF file.

Also, look for some new music in Update 09!
