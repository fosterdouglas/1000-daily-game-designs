An asynchronous multiplayer experience inside of *MiniMetro*.

While it could be fun to just go head-to-head with someone competing to build the ideal train system for a given city, there isnâ€™t much about that that pushes the gameplay in interesting ways.

Instead, it could be asynchronous.  One player is building the train system, while the other is creating the challenge.  They would be in charge of deciding which stations open up and when, which stations are which shapes, how many people come out of that station, and what shapes they are.  Basically, taking all the things an algorithm does in the current game, and letting a player decide instead.
