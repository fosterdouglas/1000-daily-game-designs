An arcade racing game made using only the human mouth to produce all sounds for the cars and environments.

We all love pretending to make car-driving noises.  This captures that imagination by using only the mouth to fabricate all the sound effects, foley, and music of the game.  The gameâ€™s visuals would also match this mood, evoking a feeling of playing with cars as a child.

The player would also have the option to record their own engine noises for their favorite cars, and share them with others.

BrumBrumBrumBrumBrum.
