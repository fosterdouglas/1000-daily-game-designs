This couch co-op game is played with two players facing one another, with the game screen in the periphery.  It’s each player’s goal to take control of the screen with their color. Sound, colors changes, flashes, subtle movements, and illusions are show on the screen as feedback to what the players are doing with the controllers. However, neither player is allowed to look directly at the screen.
