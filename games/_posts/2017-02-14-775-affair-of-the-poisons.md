This is a ridiculous event that happened in the 1600’s that I think would be an interesting setting for an interactive experience.

It could be interesting as a "telltale-style" adventure game, or even as a setting and plot for an *Assassin’s Creed* style game, with the main character being Magdelaine de La Grange.
