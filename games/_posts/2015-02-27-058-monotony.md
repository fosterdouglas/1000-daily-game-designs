Build decks of cards themed to the perils and monotony of every day life; explore these locations in a cooperative style gameplay featuring a lot of dice rolling, a little bit of luck, and almost no patience.

Example locations you might encounter:

The Mutiny of the Overcrowded Beach

(The game is heavily influenced by the [Pathfinder Adventure Card Game](http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventureCardGame "Pathfinder").)
