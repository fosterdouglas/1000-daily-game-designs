A story about Einsteinâ€™s **Theory of Special Relativity**, and what happens as it begins to unravel.

A prolific scientist discovers an unexpected spacetime anomaly, confirming that the speed of light has been decreasing (and so, the upper limit of speed of objects in the universe is decreasing).  The story follows Earth in 2205, as life and science spiral into an unfamiliar collection of motion and perception changes.
