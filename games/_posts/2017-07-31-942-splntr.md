A game made of code that slowly disintegrates, eating itself alive organically.

The code would need to be designed in a modular way, where individual pieces could be removed without breaking the entire system.

That idea is less interesting to me than an idea of something more organic. For example, a set of code that gets executed once each time the player does X action in the game. The code isn’t created to do something specific, but to randomly alter or swap variables, values, terms, functions, declarations, etc.

The player needs to continue on with these permanent changes. If the gameplay is set up in a loop, maybe this happens each time the player reaches a certain point or does a certain thing.

Maybe the player’s goal is to destroy the game they are currently playing.
