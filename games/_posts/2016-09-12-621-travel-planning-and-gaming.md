The parallels between travel planning and gaming are apparent.  When you sit down to plan a trip or activity while traveling, it pans out a lot like a game. At least in the modern era of travel planning that revolves around the internet.

It's like a dance between websites, itineraries, departures, arrivals, connections, community, culture, and interactivity.  All with the goal of creating something fun and memorable.

Maybe it's a stretch to compare them much more than this much, but I like to think the connection is there.
