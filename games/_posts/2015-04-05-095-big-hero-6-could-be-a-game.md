A 5-player local or online co-op action game, using Big Hero 6 as a theme.

I immediately realized while watching the movie Big Hero 6 that it’s characters and setting are perfectly suited for a *Gauntlet*-style co-op game.  Each of the 5 main characters in the movie and vastly different personalities, special “abilities,” and narrative roles.

All 5 characters are present for the game the whole time, and it can be played from 1 to 5 players, with the unfilled slots being played by the computer.  If all 5 roles aren’t taken by players, then any of the other players can swap characters in real time.

The characters have a simple but fun equipment system, and basic skills that can be upgraded (maybe similar to the basic skill trees in *X-COM: Enemy Unknown*).

Baymax would not be a playable character, but might be a team summon skill, or make a special appearance in some other way.

The game would also feature light amounts of puzzle solving, similar to the *LEGO* games or the recent downloadable *Lara Croft* games. 

Since the movie’s narrative took place within a fairly short time period, the game would have to be a sequel.  It may feature the professor’s daughter from the movie as an antagonist. (SPOILERS!)
