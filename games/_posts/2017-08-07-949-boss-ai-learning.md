AI bosses that learn your patterns across deaths

Similar in concept to [post 916](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/916-ai-strategy-memory/){:target="_blank"}, but for bosses or enemies in an action game.

The game uses the inputs that the player uses during a given encounter to help "teach" the AI how the player fights and to respond to it and adapt. This would only be relevant in a setup where the player was fighting an identical boss multiple times (like in a rougelike, maybe).
