In this carnival-style game, the player stands at the top of a short set of stairs. They are given a weighted round ball, about the size of a bowling ball, but with a flat bottom. The object of the game is to roll the ball down the steps, and get it  to stop on the last step before the bottom. Various prizes are given based on how close you get to stopping on the bottom step.
