This game rewards you for the time you spend signed out of your social media accounts.

It’s simple really.  Hook up this game to all of your most-used social media accounts.  Assuming you are terribly addicted to it, this game will be difficult.  You get bonus points for long streaks that you spend signed out, but aren’t necessarily penalized for using it occasionally.

Compete against your friends to find out who is the most socially disconnected!!
