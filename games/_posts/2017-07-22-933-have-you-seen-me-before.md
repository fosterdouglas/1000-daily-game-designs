A brain game, for example that might be see on Lumosity or something similar.

The game shows the player lots of people in a row, in some interesting or unique way. For example, in a sort of truncated barista/coffee shop scenario where a few dozen customers can be shown in quick succession.

The game maybe then moves on to the next day, and slowly and occasionally asks you to recall if customers are repeat customers or new ones, and which day you last saw them on.

Have you seen me before?!
