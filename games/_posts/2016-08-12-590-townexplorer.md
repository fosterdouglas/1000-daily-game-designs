A game that encourages you to explore every street in a city.

For the completionist in you!

This game would probably work best in smaller towns, but could also be applied to boroughs, villages, or districts of largers places.

Each city has its own idiosyncrasies, and this game encourages you to explore them.  Wander street by street through the city with your phone, or set up a pre-planned route to follow and have your phone vibrate if you go off track, allowing you to stay attentive and focused.

If you manage to record walking every street in the city, you're awarded a designed badge or patch of the cities logo/seal/flag.  It could also be a physical reward, maybe just requiring a few dollars to cover shipping to you.
