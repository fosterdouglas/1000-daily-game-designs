Migrate south for the winter in this bird migration adventure.

Maybe similar to the game *Shelter* or the tone of *Dear, Esther*, this game puts you in the place of a bird thatâ€™s a part of a small flock traveling south for the winter.  Experience an emotional journey, learn about the habits and experiences of the creatures that reside in the skies.

This would not be just a flying simulator, which as been a popular design since VR has become more popular.
