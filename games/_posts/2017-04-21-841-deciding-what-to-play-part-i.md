title: 841 Deciding What To Play, Part I

Right now we are in a renaissance of gaming.  Well… still.  It’s pretty much been a renaissance since it began, and it’s only getting stronger. 

And with renaissance comes innovation and prosperity.  And that means lots and lots of choice about what to spend our precious hours playing. Like, dozens of games "officially" released each day on Steam, dozens more released each week on consoles, and an innumerable amount made on smaller, free platforms.

That’s a lot of games.

So how do we decide which ones to play?

Well, I can say how I choose.  It’s a deliberate balance of research, experimenting, preference, and open-mindedness. And a bit of careful planning.  In a [future post](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/934-deciding-what-to-play-part-ii/){:target="_blank"}, I’ll break down each of these and define them.
