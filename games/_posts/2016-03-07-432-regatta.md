A sailing game.

Modeled in some ways off of the ship sailing sequences in the *Assassinâ€™s Creed* series (first introduced in *AC3*, I think), but updated to reflect modern sailing trends.

Regatta would feature various modes, some which are focused on racing, and others on leisure, tourism, or exploratory sailing. The game would be played entirely through switching between members of the crew; the boat itself would not be controllable directly.  Players must learn how to gauge wind speeds, respond to changing environments, command other characters, and work together as a team to conquer the high seas.
