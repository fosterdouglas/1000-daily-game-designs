Realize the gravity of a decision on whether to have an abortion or not.

In this narrative-based game, after a long amount of story and exposition, and character attachment, the player is forced to make the decision to either get an abortion or keep the baby (for their own or for later adoption).  This decision completely affects the game’s story.

However, the story is such that the player never has a baby, regardless of which choice they make.  The baby isn’t born if they choose abortion (obviously), and the baby is a miscarriage if they choose to keep it.  The emotion involved focuses on attachment, decision, regret, sadness, and relief.
