A percussion-only rhythm game using analog sticks to control the bass and snare drum.

For example, the left analog stick is bass drum, and the right analog stick is snare.  The player is "snapping" a colored line from left hand side to right hand side for the snare drum, and top/bottom for the bass drum.

This could potentially do a great job of recreating the difficulty of doing two things at once at separate timings/rhythms (like playing a bass part on piano with your left hand and a melody with your right hand).
