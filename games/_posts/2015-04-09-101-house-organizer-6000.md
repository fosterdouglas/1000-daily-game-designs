A piece of software that you helps you organize (and re-roganize) your house’s furniture and items.  To get started, just input the WxHxD measurements for each piece of furniture, and the program will automatically create items on your virtual blueprint playground.  Alternatively, if you purchased standard pieces of furniture from IKEA, Target, Pottery Barn, and other similar places, just search for the name of the item and select it. 

Once all your furniture is input, you can start moving around pieces and creating various designs.  The software will suggest recommended walk space sizes, incorporate door swing angles, drawer depths, and other specific usability factors.  Make multiple layouts, try different setups, and be prepared and efficient once it’s time to physically move your furniture!
