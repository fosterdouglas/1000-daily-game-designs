A petrol-pocolypse world where petrol became scarce before we were quite prepared to live without it.  Three sisters must drive from Cheyenne, Wyoming to Mount Whitney in California, with an extremely important piece of cargo. They must use ingenuity as the three women cross through the Wyoming Basin and beyond, constantly on the search for petrol to keep them moving.

The petrol meter is a best friend (and worst enemy) in this game. Gas is used in real time by the car, and the days pass in real time, as well.  The drive runs through Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Death Valley, taking around 24 hours total to complete.  In the story, the three women have just over 30 hours to get where the need to.  The game is lost if they donâ€™t arrive in time.
