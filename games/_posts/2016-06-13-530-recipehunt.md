A recipe app with healthy kid-friendly snacks and meals that kids can look at and mark the ones that look good to them.  Parents get notified in the app and can easily copy ingredients to a shopping list, getting kids excited about looking at ingredients and picking healthy things they can make themselves.

The app would feature a connected game, either a match-3 or a RPG/adventure where the focus is on crafting or finding recipes that can then be explored together with your parents in the kitchen.
