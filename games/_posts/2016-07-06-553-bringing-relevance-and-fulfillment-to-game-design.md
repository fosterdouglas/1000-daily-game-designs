title: 553 Bringing Relevance And Fulfillment To Game Design
tags: game-opinion
---
One of my daily struggles as a game designer is figuring out how to bring relevance to the games and ideas that I work on.  And how that relevance affects people in the world.

I can’t personally exist as a game designer without thinking about this.  We all do things in our lives to create meaning and bring purpose to our occupations (hopefully!).  How do I justify to myself that being a game designer is the right thing for me to focus my life on?  It can be a hard question to answer. How does a doctor justify focusing their life on treating people? That one’s a little easier… they’re saving lives on a daily basis, and that’s something that needs to happen in our reality, and I imagine they get a great amount of fulfillment from that.

We can’t all be doctors, though.  So how can I bring relevance to my game design that is on par with the relevance that (I am assuming) a doctor might feel on a daily basis when they are helping patients.

I’m not sure yet about the answer to this, but it’s something that I think about often.
