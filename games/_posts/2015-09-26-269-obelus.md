A literary brain game about corrupt information inside passages of text.

Read a paragraph of text, and apply your Obelus to the sentence that doesnâ€™t belong with the rest.  More advanced levels may require you to identify just a single word, have increased lengths of paragraph text, or multiple instances of corrupt text in a single paragraph.
