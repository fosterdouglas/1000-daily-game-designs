A brain training game that requires you to listen carefully and identify sounds within soundscapes.

It would start out simple; the game would play audio and the player would have to choose from a multiple choice list what the sound was.  It might be “an electric fan,” “an engine,” or “machinery.”  As the levels progress, the player must begin to pick out individual sounds within a collection of sounds, or memorize certain sounds that play while others play before and after it. The final difficulty stages would have the player inputting (without multiple choice) all the individual sounds they hear that are making up the soundscape, once they’ve been exposed to all the potential sounds individually and have them memorized.
