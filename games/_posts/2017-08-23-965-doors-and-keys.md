The classic trope of doors and keys is a well-worn fallback design that so many games use. It’s a simple design system, there’s something blocking the way, and there’s something that can remove that block. Often times the "door" and "key" are obscured into something else, like a boss being a door and being high enough level to beat it is the key. But even more often, it literally is doors and keys.

So, it may be interesting, designing a game that’s specifically commenting on this trope, and subverting it in some interesting way.
