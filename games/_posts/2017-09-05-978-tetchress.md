A chess-like where the shapes of the pieces are equivalent to what each can move in standard chess.

On player’s turn they can either move a piece, or rotate a piece.

There are a few things that aren’t clear how they’d work, like the diagonal pieces. And I’m not sure of the general goal overall… it was just an interesting vague idea.
