I’m deeply interested in the algorithms behind the AI in simulation games.

It’s probably one of those things where if I actually knew the details, it wouldn’t be nearly as interesting as I’m imagining it to be.  But maybe not.

What I’m mostly curious about is, let’s say in a game like *Planet Coaster*, how the AI actually decides to interact with something multiple times.  I talked about this [a little bit](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/679-ai-curiosity/){:target="_blank"} before, but the topic is pretty deep and complex.

Is it a random decision that the AI makes on whether they come back to the park or not?  Or if they go on a roller coaster twice, or visit a food shop multiple times during a visit?  It probably is random.  And that doesn’t really make a lot of sense.  The decisions we make in life are rarely random. 

Hopefully it’s based on wether or not they enjoyed that specific thing the last time they did it.  But that introduces another issue… how do you make a piece of code decide wether or not it enjoyed something?
