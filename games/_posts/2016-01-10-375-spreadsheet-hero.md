A game for bored office workers to play inside their boring spreadsheet application.

The game would look and behave exactly like a typical spreadsheet document.  The numbers and boxes would represent different characters, environments, statistics, enemies, objectives, and more, depending on the genre of the game.

(Thanks Kevin!)
