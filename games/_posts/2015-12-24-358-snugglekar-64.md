A puzzle game about driving and snuggling.

Set in an alternate universe where all cars on the road are driven by at least two people at once, use your puzzle-solving skills to arrange your carâ€™s occupants correctly.  All drivers of the car must be facing correctly, with each having access to a steering wheel.  Arrange the position, facing, limbs, and spacing of each person in the car.  As the levels increase in difficulty, more complex car interior designs must be conquered, while having to accommodate additional passengers and overcome other obstacles.
