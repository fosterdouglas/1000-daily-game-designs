title: 131 Metrico Needed A Level Editor

There were many great things about the recent puzzle/platformer Metrico.  It was smart, streamlined, short, visually interesting, and aurally wonderful.  There were also some misses.  The extreme minimalism wasn’t doing it any good, the shortness could also be considered a negative, and in my opinion, the game could have transcended itself with a socially focused custom level editor.  The game’s tools would have been perfect for a *Littlebigplanet*-style editing mode, and the ability to share those creations and play others’.  See below for a crude rendering:
