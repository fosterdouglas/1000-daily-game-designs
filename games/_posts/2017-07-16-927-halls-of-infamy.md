A meta game where you challenge all of the greatest and most difficult bosses from all of video gaming history.

The visual style or presentation would need to be a unifying factor, and the disparate types and styles of bosses would need to be reimagined in ways that worked within the unification. There would also be a system in place for new bosses to be added, from games yet to be released, and they become inducted into the Halls Of Infamy.
