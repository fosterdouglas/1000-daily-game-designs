In this web game, start with an entire screen of large pixels of 100’s of different colors.  Your goal is to find and reveal the hidden white pixels beneath the colored ones.

When a pixel is clicked, another pixel somewhere else on the screen flips over to reveal its b-side.  However, that clicked pixel isn’t the only pixel that will flip over that tile. Use deduction and careful planning to flip over and reveal all the white tiles on the board.  Later more difficult levels will reveal multiple tiles’ b-sides on a single pixel clicked, requiring even more careful planning.
