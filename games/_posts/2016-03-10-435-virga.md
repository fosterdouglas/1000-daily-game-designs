A story about earth using rain as a power source.

Humans have long exploited water to power various forms of technology. In this story, we take it further by developing a system that collects the energy from falling rainwater, stores it, and then lets it pass through to the ground as intended.

The story would deal with the moral, ethical, and environmental advantages/disadvantages of implementing this technology on a global scale.  Is it worth completely altering the way our planet functions ecologically to continue powering our planetâ€™s technologies and growth?
