Why do we always play characters that are sneaking past security guards? Nobody ever wants to play as the security guard.

In this simulation, you’ll be in charge of the night-to-night routine of a low-ranking security guard.  You must learn how to focus on your job to keep on task, stave off sleepiness and hunger, and be able to multitask.  You’ll also need to identify serious threats from false alarms, apprehend minor criminals, drink coffee, and eat donuts.
