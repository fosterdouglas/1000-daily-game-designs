An online, iterative, compounding game of telephone.

At the beginning of each week, a single person is chosen to experience a story.  Then, itâ€™s their task to recreate and retell the story to two other people.  Those two people tell two more each, and so on.

At the end of the week, all of the final iterations are collected and presented as comparison to the original story.  Points are awarded to all contributors in the tree of the winning story.
