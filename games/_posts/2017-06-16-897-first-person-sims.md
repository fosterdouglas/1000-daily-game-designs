A game system like *The Sims* but played entirely in first-person view.

Potentially this could be a synchronous multiplayer game, where a household is built and then all of the players that play within that household play first-person versions of their character.  The game could only be played when all people were available to be playing it together.  Most of the other systems of *The Sims* could likely stay intact.
