An iPad game about about cleaning houses.

MaruMaru must organize all the junk in each room of the house!  Swipe and throw items to different corners of the iPad to organize them quickly.  Decide how to group them on the fly; by size, color, category, shape, and others.  Make cohesive organization plans to avoid any unseen accidents or additional messes from appearing.  Organize quickly and intelligently to make everything neat again!

In the downtime between cleaning, manage Maru’s cleaning service company by hiring employees to assist her, upgrading cleaning equipment, and collecting leads for bigger and messier houses to tame.

A game in the *Order in Chaos* series.

(*Order in Chaos* is inspired by Steve Gaynor’s thoughts on order and chaos in video games, featured on Critical Path https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT7zFz0SuDg)
