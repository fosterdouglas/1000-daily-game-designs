Before we can move on too much further with *Hay*, we have to start testing the actual gameplay experience and rules.  Once this initial testing happens, we can then start to iterate and move toward a more confident idea of what the game is like.  And once **that** happens, we’ll be more prepared to start actually coding the game.

So (and much thanks to my SCAD Graduate classes), it’s time to bust out [Paper Prototyping](http://smile.amazon.com/dp/1558608702){:target="_blank"}.

Check out the images below for the prototype that I whipped up.  I’ll be testing this soon, against a few different sets of rules I’ve designed. I’ll post those rules tomorrow, and the testing results later in the week.
