---
A board game that’s played entirely inside of its box.

An adventure board game through a miniature crafted fantasy setting, right inside the box it came in!  Similar to games like *Fireball Island* or *Life*, this game would be played on a board that has been made to look like a landscape. The game would focus on rolling dice, moving characters, drawing cards, and cooperating through the adventure’s story with up to 3 other people.  The box would be versatile and dynamic, constantly changing with the rules and scenarios of the game.

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Card Hunter*** and **Armello** ]
