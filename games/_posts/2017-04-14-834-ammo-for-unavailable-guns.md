title: 834 Ammo For Unavailable Guns

I wrote this idea down while playing Destiny with my friend and fellow VG-lover Corey.

But, as I think more about it, I think I’ve played games that do this.  The idea is that you pick up ammo for guns you might not have yet, or don’t have equipped or can’t use.  It’s not just that the ammo you need is always magically sitting in a pile on the floor in the room you happen to be walking through.

 The first *Bioshock* is coming to mind, I recall it doing something like this, but maybe not to an extreme.  But it’s hard to say if it was intentional, or if I was just in an area I wasn’t supposed to be where the game assumed I had already picked up a certain gun, and I happened to haven’t found it yet.

I think this is an idea that fits snugly with my strong ideas on realism in gaming.  Quit holding my hand, let me find what I find and adapt to the situation and search harder if I need something I don’t have.
