title: 144 Cooperative Play Shouldn't Be An Afterthought

Over the past week, I’ve been playing a lot of co-op games.  My friend Eric was visiting me, and we’re known to plow through some great cooperative game experiences.  However, it was clear to us the dire situation that cooperative games have been facing lately.

More than a couple of the games we excitedly put in to play turned out to be completely incompatible with couch cooperative play.  Others claimed to include it, but hide the mode behind an an hour or more of “tutorial” play where the 2nd player can’t participate.  Even more often though, we found games that had integrated cooperative play where the 2nd player’s input is somehow compromised, limited, or dumbed down compared to the 1st player.

It’s not that I’m on a crusade for every game ever made to have cooperative play.  But I do think that it’s a huge issue, and the market is there for people who want to play games together cooperatively with their friends.
