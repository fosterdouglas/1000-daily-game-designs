A game spent in the clouds.

This childrenâ€™s game focuses on teaching children about clouds, what they do for our ecosystem, and how clouds can create happiness just as well as the sun can.

In the sandbox mode of this game, players can touch, interact, manipulate, create, and in all ways affect clouds in their sky-scape.  It encourages players to explore all the types of clouds, and teaches them small facts as they go.

In challenge mode, kids learn more detailed facts about recognizing cloud types and their meanings.

I designed a similar game [way back when](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/053-learn-the-clouds/){:target="_blank"}, but this would be much more focused on the interactivity and beauty of clouds.
