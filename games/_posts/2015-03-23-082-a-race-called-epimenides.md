title: 082 A Race Called Epimenides
tags: narrative-game
---
In this story premise, there exists a race of people called Epimenides, who are, in fact, liars.  Not everything an Epimendie says is a lie, but each and every one of them are liars at their core.  They are a group of people that lie to survive; like thieves, deception is their strongest attribute. 

As a game, the story would play with the players sense of truth and reality, since they are dropped into the role of an Epimendie.  The player must use language to decide how to portray their character.
