At the [500 posts mark](https://www.foster-douglas.com/games/500-the-big-five-oh-oh/){:target="_blank"}, I streamed 500 minutes of games to celebrate, and I’d like to do that again to commemorate hitting 1000 posts.

That’s over 16 hours, which is basically an entire day of gaming. Sounds awesome, and I have some ideas about what to play. Unfortunately, for simplicity sake, it’ll be only PS4 games available, because streaming the marathon will be easiest that way. I’d like to keep variety mostly, but also pick a few games that I can start and finish entirely, and a few others for interest and diversity:

- Gravity Rush (partial)
- Spider-Man (partial)
- Persona 5 Dancing In Starlight (partial)
- What Remains of Edith Finch
- Donut County
- Wattam
- Armello or The Sims 4
- Doom
