title: 123 Dynamic NPC Audio Dialogue
tags: game-mechanic/system

A system that eliminates the player from ever hearing “repeating” audio dialogue in voice-over narrative games.

One thing I often find immersion breaking is when NPCs have repeated conversations with one another, or repeat lines outlaid to the player, or to themselves.  This is happens likely because writing, recording, and implementing an infinite number of lines of dialogue just isn’t practical. 

One way to help alleviate this potential, is to have a system to keep record of which dialogue lines the player has “heard” so far.  That is to say, which things the player has been in earshot of when they were cued.  With this data, the game can better fully manage the player’s unique audio experience.
