This mobile time-management/puzzle game pits you against all the people you know but don’t want to see at a cafe in your old hometown.

Friends, colleagues, acquaintances, friends of friends, and teachers would all be featured as obstacles.  Final bosses would be relatives or ex-girlfriends. Drag your avatar around the cafe, avoiding line-of-sight with anybody you know.  Find the best routes to get to the counter, where to wait for your coffee, how to get to the restroom, and eventually leave the cafe without being seen.
