title: 861 Thoughts On Zip Zap

The iOS game *Zip Zap* transcends, just barely, the standard "superficially unique puzzle mechanic spread across 100 generically increasing levels" trope.

Something about it is more heartfelt than many iOS puzzle games end up feeling, while still maintaining my interest and feeling fun and varied.

There’s also something unique and interesting about games that are almost purely physics-based, because they seem to inherintly feel less frustrating.  This might be because I know, as a player, that the game isn’t taking advantage of me in any way, and that the physics are correctly at work.

I haven’t yet finished the game, but I can’t imagine my opinion will change much when I do.
