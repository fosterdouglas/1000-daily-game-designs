A sequel to the most beloved *Mario Kart* game.

This N64 cart-mod would focus on taking everything that made the original *Mario Kart 64* great, and building on that.

Things people love about the original:

- The feel of interacting with the game; the N64 controller is key, the joystick movement, the "Z" button placement, the awkward feel… it all makes the game control the way it does.
- The characters; not too few and not too many makes it fun and interesting but not complicated.
- The maps; fun and memorable, but with enough surprises to stay difficult without being over-the-top.
- The items; nothing useless and nothing overpowered, just a good balance.

Proposed additions and enhancements to *65* would keep all of the above in mind, respecting these traits and building around them rather than overtop them.

Now, I’m not saying that the new *Mario Kart* on the Nintendo Switch isn’t a great iteration (actually I’m not saying much at all about it since I’ve never actually played it, just watched a lot of it streamed), I just think that there’s room for a bit of a nostalgic kick-back the the game’s earlier roots.
