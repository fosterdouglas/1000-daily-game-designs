title: 762 The Original Ticket To Ride

[This game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Train){:target="_blank"} is an interesting multiplayer strategy game using dominoes.

Ticket To Ride is essentially a derivative of it, except that Mexican Train doesnâ€™t have a board to play on.  This game has a bit of interesting additional strategy, with a system of "public" trains that can be stolen by other players and become "private" and then can be lost again.

I love seeing when modern games take inspiration from or are influenced by past games, especially when care is taken to honor the original while iterating or innovating on the idea.
