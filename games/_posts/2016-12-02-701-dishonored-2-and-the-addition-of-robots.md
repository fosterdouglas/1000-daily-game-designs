title: 701 Dishonored 2 And The Addition Of Robots
categories: game-opinion
---
About half-way through *Dishonored 2*, the game introduces a new type of obstacle, basically robots.  In the first game there were some things that were robot-like, but still controlled or driven by a human.

I play the *Dishonored* series in a method they call "low chaos" which basically means I play the game trying not to kill anybody as I go.  Adding robots actually introduced a pretty massive shift in the gameplay.  Up until then, everything, more-or-less, could be taken down in the game with a sleeping dart or other passive means.  Since robots canâ€™t be put to sleep, it forces the player, especially a player that plays in the style that I do, to adjust the way to approach situations.

Particularly because there was never really a difference between most human enemies in the game, from a stealth play through perspective.  You just need to sneak up behind them, and put them to sleep.  With the non-human enemies, it forces the player even to use items in their inventory that typically go unused.
