A mobile game where the distance you walk gains you experience, health, or abilities in game.

The game would use GPS, not a pedometer, to track your on-foot movement during the day.  The more you move, the more potential you gain in game to spend on abilities, or other mechanics depending on the type of gameplay.

It would be designed to promote healthy living through daily movement, as well as also being an awesome game.
