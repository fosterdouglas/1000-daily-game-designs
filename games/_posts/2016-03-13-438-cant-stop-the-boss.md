A game about physical endurance.

Which physical activities can you do straight for the equivalent time of a Bruce Springsteen performance?

The Boss typically plays 3 to 4 hour long sets.  Can you do any of these (less intense) activities for the same uninterrupted amount of time:

- Walk
- Jog lightly
- Read
- Not watch TV
- Eat celery
- â€¦ and more!
