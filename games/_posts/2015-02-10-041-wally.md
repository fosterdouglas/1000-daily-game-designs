A digital *Where is Waldo?* simulator.

Take the crazy and wackiness of a *Where Is Waldo?* book, and explore it into a 3D game space where the player can walk around and interact.  There are different goals for each map, like various collectibles, and tasks given by the people on the map. It encourages young kids to learn how to play first-person based games without needing to play violent first-person shooters.
