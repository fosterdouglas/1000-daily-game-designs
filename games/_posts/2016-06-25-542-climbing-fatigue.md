title: 542 Climbing Fatigue
categories: game-mechanic-system

Similar to yesterday’s mechanic, this would be used in an adventure/exploration game that uses climbing regularly in its core gameplay.

I always found it strange in the *Uncharted* series that Nathan Drake and company could climb and climb and climb forever, without fatigue.  I’ve already suspended my disbelief that they could make some of these climbs and jumps in the first place, but it seems to be too far a stretch to ignore their near-endless stamina for climbing.

A fatigue mechanic for this might be kind of interesting.  The player would have some sort of indication or meter that would let them know that their character was slowly fatiguing and will soon lose grip.  Not revolutionary, but certainly something to potentially increase immersion.
