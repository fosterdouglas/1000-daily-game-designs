A 4-player party game where you play cards sequentially to kidnap the Queen of Hearts. 

The Queen of Hearts is removed from the deck and placed face down in the center of the table. Each player is dealt a King, and places it facedown near them. The remaining 3 Queens are removed, and the rest of the deck is dealt out evenly amongst the 4 players around the table.  Each playerâ€™s base King card should be roughly equidistant from the Queen. 

The goal of this game is to connect your King to the Queen of Hearts using the cards in your hand.  Cards must be played sequentially (i.e. Jack, 10, 9, 8), from the Queen outward toward your King. The first person to connect the Queen and their King with an entire sequential set of cards wins.  Trading and bartering cards is encouraged.
