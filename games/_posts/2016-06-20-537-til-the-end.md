A multi-chapter RPG that starts from the end and progresses backward through events.

The game is still played forward linearly, but each successive chapter is set before the previous, and ends where the previous chapter began. This is merely a narrative mechanic; character progression would have to be cleverly designed so that it still worked.  It would definitely be a vehicle for some interesting game design, though.
