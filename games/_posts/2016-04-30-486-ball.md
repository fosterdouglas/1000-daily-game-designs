A digital version of that children’s game where you throw a ball back and forth and take one step back each time you throw it.

Maybe it’s like *Pong*, except each time the ball hits the paddle, the paddles move further away from each other.

         |o      |

       |           o|

    |o                  |

|                          o|

And so on.
