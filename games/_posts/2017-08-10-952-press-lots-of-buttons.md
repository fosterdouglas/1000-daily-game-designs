A skill system or mechanic that allows you to invent and press tons of buttons at once on your controller or keyboard.

There are plenty of examples, generally fighting games, that sometimes result in players "mashing" buttons to win, but itâ€™s generally not the way the game was designed. It would be interesting if the game required the player to do this and to be creative in the order or method of the "mashing."
