In this twist on the classic "tower defense‚Äù genre, the towers you place down are much more permanent.  The game takes place on a single map, that continually expands in different directions as you progress through the levels.

The towers you place would grow and change with you, much like a character does in an RPG. Towers can still be moved and destroyed, but only at a great cost to the player.

Each successive level would exist as expansions on area built from past levels, culminating into a giant map at the end of the game.
