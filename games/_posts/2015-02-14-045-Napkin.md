Take photos of your bar napkin drawings or musings, and share them with strangers around the world.

This game encourages you to respond to strangers with increasingly witty, interesting, provocative, or just plain weird bar napkin scribbles.  As your score increases, you become a prime target for napkin attacks, threatening to lower your score.

(Inspired by the song We Moved created by [The DNA Project](http://jviewz.com/#/dna "DNA Project"))
