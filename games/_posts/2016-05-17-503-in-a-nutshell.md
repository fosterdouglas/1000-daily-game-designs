A murder mystery game set in a [nutshell diorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutshell_Studies_of_Unexplained_Death){:target="_blank"}.

A murder/homicide/crime scene investigation game, without the "dark and creepy" pretense. Use crime scenes to determine solutions to complex crime problems, with a presentation or art style that looks like Frances Glessner Leeâ€™s famous educational nutshell dioramas.
