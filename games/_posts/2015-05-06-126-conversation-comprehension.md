In this brain training exercise, you’re presented with messages shown sequentially, such as in a Messaging program.  The messages are from and to multiple different people, and its your task to keep track of each of the different conversations’ content. 

A difficulty setting (based on past performance) will dictate how difficult the exercise is.  This may mean up to 5 different conversations happening, with some people interacting with multiple conversations at once. As the conversation scrolls up, the history of messages fades away.

The ultimate goal in the end is to be able to group the names of people into which conversations they were apart of. Advanced levels might have you naming from memory what the conversation was about, or who contributed the most/least.
