A 5-turn variation on Chess.

In this variation, each player has 5 standard Chess moves to use before their turn is over.

I will need to test this to see if it’s viable at all as a variation.  It would obviously destroy many of the strategic aspects of Chess, but would likely introduce a few new ones that may be interesting.  Yes, you get 5 whole moves to use on your turn, but don’t forget that after those are over, so does your opponent have 5 moves.  Interesting.
