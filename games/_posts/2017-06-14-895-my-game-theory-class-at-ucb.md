title: 895 My Game Theory Class At UCB
tags: game-theory
---
This summer, I am taking a game theory class.  I expect it to be incredibly challenging, and based on the first day of class, it might even exceed those expectations.

The class is focused partially on the theory of game theory (ha!) and partially on the math, calculations, and proof of those theories.  I don’t expect to understand much of the math, although I’ll do my best to.  My primary goal is get a better understanding of how the fundamental systems of a **game** work and how that spills into contemporary game design.

I’m sure what I’m to learn will spill over into the ideas and writings on this blog.
