Today for our 2nd tech test, the **hex board**, Kevin has succeeded in creating the hex board using the Javascript and HTML Canvas.  Itâ€™s a basic step, but a very important one for the game.  More iterations on this are coming later this week.  Also look out for a finalized version of our first tech test soon, the **style menu**.
