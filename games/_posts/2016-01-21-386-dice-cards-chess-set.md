A collection of dice and cards that doubles as a set of chess pieces.

This product is a solution to creating a portable and multifunctional chess set that can also serve other gaming functions, in a compact but useable package. The dice would be standard sized dice, featuring a graphic of each of the chess set pieces on a separate dice, in place of the usual #1 side.  The chess board would be built using the included deck of square cards, of which have black backs and (mostly) white faces that can be placed alternatively to create the checkered chess board.

The set may be adapted and tweaked for additional uses; potentially one side of the dice could be painted black and one red, to allow the set to also be used for checkers.
