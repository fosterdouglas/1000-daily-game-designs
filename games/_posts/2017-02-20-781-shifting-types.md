An experimental education game that helps you learn how to type and navigate your keyboard more dynamically.

Copy and rewrite the words on the screen, but be prepared to change what youâ€™re typing as it changes.  It will also include ALL keys of the keyboard, as well as all the SHIFT-holding variations, and even some commonly used ALT-holding variations, like the copyright and trademark symbols. 

Includes support for the various alternate keyboard layouts.
