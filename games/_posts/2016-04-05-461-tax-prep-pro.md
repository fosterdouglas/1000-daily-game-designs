A game for people who love doing taxes.

This semi-educational game that pits the player against solving some difficult and complex tax situations.  The player is given a set amount of information via tax documents from the year, receipts, W-2’s and other forms.  They must use the information to prepare the client’s taxes to perfection; mistakes will not be tolerated.

This game focuses on teaching the player general tax skills, as well as how to make doing taxes a slightly less terrible of a process.
