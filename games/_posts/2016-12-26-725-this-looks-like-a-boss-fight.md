title: 725 This Looks Like A Boss Fight

A phrase I heard *CohCarnage* say on Twitch recently… "This looks like a boss fight."

Many gamers have probably thought a similar phrase before.

It’s interesting how over the years, games have trained their more seasoned players to expect a boss at certain points in a game.  In this specific case, it was actually the physical design of the space in the game that gave it away to the player that it was some part more important than the rest of the level.

I’ve talked about it before, but this is the developers of these games leaning on our past experiences with games.  And while I don’t think that’s something inherently bad, it can definitely be something to be aware of and avoid in order to push the medium forward.
