A card game about deception and information as a commodity, featuring a system where the front of your hand of cards tells one story, and the back tells another.

This game comes with two full decks of standard playing cards. Both decks are shuffled together, and each player draws 8 cards from the 104-card deck. 4 of these cards must be picked as your own, and the other four as free-trade cards.  Each player then takes the roll of included non-stick painters tape, rips off small pieces, and connects each of their free-trade cards to back of one of their own cards.

The game is a trading game, where you can use the information on the front that influences the type of card on the back.
