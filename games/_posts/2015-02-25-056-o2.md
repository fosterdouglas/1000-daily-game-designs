A game story where the percentge of O2 in our breathable air has dropped below a level that humans need to function properly, at around an average of 7% at sea level altitude.  Oxygen is scarce, and a new worldwide epidemic has arisen; air oxygenation.  Political intrigue, sociological dispute, ethical and moral decisions, and the future of humanity come into play.

Deep within the Earthâ€™s crust there contains a layer with a significant amount of the O element (in many oxide compounds), however the question is raised whether we should be destroying our own home to continue fueling our survival.
