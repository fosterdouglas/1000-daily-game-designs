The game is coming along nicely.

Kevin has made a myriad of backend changes to clean up the code as we move forward.  He’s got a .json file saving the various challenge types that we’re adding (see [update 05](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/230-dicey-update-05/) for details on the design of the challenges).  He’s also squashed a bug with custom fonts loading, and made structure updates to the code that will help down the line.  

Below is an update on the music.  It’s still going through many changes and tweaks, but the skeleton is slowly forming!
