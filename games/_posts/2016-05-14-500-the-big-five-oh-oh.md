If anyone missed out, today I had my **500 minute celebration stream**! below are links to each of the games played.  Enjoy!

1/6 [An introduction](https://youtu.be/SPWRff6fYqs){:target="_blank"}
2/6 [Playing Armello](https://youtu.be/_BlwL_8IOT8){:target="_blank"}
3/6 [Playing Uncharted 4](https://youtu.be/z_43V450xa0){:target="_blank"}
4/6 [Playing Life is Strange](https://youtu.be/4_UJ7IGkGis){:target="_blank"}
5/6 [Playing Tropico 5](https://youtu.be/JcpDn1Zgxg4){:target="_blank"}
6/6 [Playing The Witness](https://youtu.be/dgufRm-H3nU){:target="_blank"}

I’ll probably be doing more streams in the future (probably not 8 hours long, though), so check out my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fostywosty){:target="_blank"} page periodically to find out when that might be!
