A game about the heroics of an unassuming web developer.

In this top-down adventuring game, play as a web developer with a righteous mission to teach the world about web design.  Using his/her technology superpowers, take down the evil corporations, lackluster website designs, and clueless clients one by one.  Every conceivable web/tech joke or reference would be in this game. Level designs would be based on some of the most famous web sites, frameworks, and programs related to web development.

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Mario Vs Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!*** and ***XCOM: Enemy Within*** ]
