title: 970 Time Manipulation Platformer

Jonathan Blow’s *Braid* was the not the first game to use time manipulation, but it is one of the best. And, it is one of the first to use it in the 2D platformer genre.

The difficulty in *Braid* was mostly about solving the puzzles, and not as much about executing the maneuvers (although sometimes it was also about that). It’d be interesting if a game were so incredibly difficult (like *VVVVVV* or *Celeste* but more), that the game design itself required some sort of time manipulation mechanic.

Because *Braid* was a puzzle game, the rewind system could be used infinitely, to encourage experimentation. It could also be interesting to limit this resource, either by X number of times it can be enabled, or as a metered resource that slowly drains while it’s being used.
