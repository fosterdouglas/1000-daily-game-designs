Last month, I designed a few games focused around emoji.  Kevin and I are developing a few of these into playable tests, and [emojiFace](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/397-emojiface/){:target="_blank"} is first up!

This screen capture is a week or two old, but the game is in progress, and we hope to have it up on the app store in the next month or so!
