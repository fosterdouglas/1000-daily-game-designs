A game with fused together groups of cards, in sets of 3, 5, and 7.

This card game comes with some very unique cards.  They are essentially cut out objects in the shape of someone holding a fan of 3, 5, or 7 cards.  What’s on the cards would be predetermined, although each card set would be different.  Players would pick from the different sized sets depending on the situation, eventually holding a hand full of hands of cards.  It’s all very meta.
