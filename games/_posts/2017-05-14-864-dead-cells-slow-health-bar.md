Although I haven’t played *Dead Cells* yet, watching it being streamed has left an impression on me.

I love the health bar system.  It works a little bit like it the system in *Earthbound*, actually.  Here:

![deadcells](/img/games/864_Dead_Cells_Slow_Health_Bar.gif "deadcells")

When the player is damaged by an enemy, that amount is cut down from the total health available, and then slowly dwindles.  As an added point of interest, a percentage of damage dealt by the player to an enemy **during** the health dwindle is given back to them.

There’s not much to say about this other than I think it’s absolutely an interesting and simple reimagining of the standard action game health bar.  Keep up the innovation, designers and developers!
