An experimental keystroke tracking game/app for Apple’s touch bar laptops.

This experience is mostly visual and obscure.  It would take the keystrokes you’re making and in real time create a cloud of color and swirls based on the frequency and speed of the typing.  Somewhat like those old music visualizers that were popular in the early 2000s, except way less cheesy. 

The clouds and swirls could then be interacted with via touch, sliding them, spinning them, and pushing them.
