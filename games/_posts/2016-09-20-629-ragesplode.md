I don't know what this is, but I think it's the perfect term for something in gaming.  Maybe a mobile game? Maybe a word you belt out when you go into frenzy mode.  Maybe the last name of an over-the-top action character, like Jack Ragesplode. It also sounds like something Mr. Torgue would say in *Borderlands*.
