A web game/app that makes bedroom interior design more fun and affordable!

This game uses some advanced web image search tech (Google, I’m looking at you!) to help streamline the process of finding, coordinating, and buying bedroom décor.

For example, using a simplified color scheme picker to explore different color schemes, organically building your room from its base color on up.  Once this and other parameters are chosen, the image search tool begins scouring the web for products and solutions that may fit into this.  It looks on traditional sites like Target, IKEA, Macy’s, and more, as well as on more obscure places like Instagram, Pinterest, or Google Images.

(Thanks Madeleine!)
