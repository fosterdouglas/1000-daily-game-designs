A game about cleaning things.

In this RPG, use you play as Jethro, an OCD janitor. Clean your way up the ranks of the janitorial staff at a local middle school, choosing your path upward to King of the Broom.

Avoid the mundane and madness of daily life by talking and texting your friends on your phone, checking Facebook in your down time, and slacking off when the boss isn’t around.  Don’t get caught though, or you may be fired and forced to find a new job.
