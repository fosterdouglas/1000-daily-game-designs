An interactive tea making and drinking experience.

This is a beautiful and mindful application/game that teaches you the basic (or advanced) techniques of making a proper cup of tea through simple and memorable interactions.

It’s focused on slow, deliberate interaction, and encourages the user to consider deeply what they are doing and to internalize it and eventually apply it to their own tea-making routine.

Alternatively, there could be a mode that you use **while** making your tea to assist you, although the primary function of the application would be to teach the skills required, not just a follow-the-instructions system.
