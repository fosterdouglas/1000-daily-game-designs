A game about body predictions in a relationship.

Predict how in tune you are with your partner. Make daily, weekly, or monthly predictions about your partner’s biology.  Make wagers on when they’ll fall asleep, how many times they go pee, whether they will get a cold or not this month, what day of the month their period starts (sorry, ladies only), and more.

Kind of a weird game actually, now that I’ve written it out.

(Thanks Madeleine!)
