Played entirely on the sides of buildings and other objects, this side scrolling platform has a super-stylized graffiti visual look.

Each level might take place in a specific area with a lot of graffiti, like a rail yard or an industrial park.  Or each level might have a specific graffiti style that it exploits in detail.  The player isnâ€™t an actual character in the game, but instead manipulates the shapes and things to progress through the puzzles and levels.

(Kind of like *Lost in Shadow* meets *Contrast* meets the wall parts of *The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds*.)
