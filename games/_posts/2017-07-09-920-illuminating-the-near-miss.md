title: 920 The Great Sports/Non-Sports Game Divide

It’s an interesting and perplexing phenomenon that in contemporary gaming there exists a very distinct divide. There are many sectors and niches and genres and preferences of course… indie gaming, mobile gaming, VR gaming, tabletop gaming, and so on.

But the divide between people who play sports video games and those that don’t is so unfathomably wide. Unless you’re looking for it, you won’t weeks of media coverage and thousands of review about the newest Madden game, not on the outlets that cover every other type of video game anyway. It’s like it doesn’t exist.

Likewise, the culture of gamers that play sports games are as into them as the culture that doesn’t is are into their own, and maybe even more passionately so.

The curious part comes when you think about how uneven the two groups are: sports-playing gamers play exact one game genre, and non-sports-playing gamers play many genres generally.

Of course most of the above is wildly generalized. There are plenty of people who play both, I’m sure. But it is an interesting phenomenon that I wonder if has been written about much before.

The exception to this rule might be racing games, which seems seated awkwardly centered between the divide.
