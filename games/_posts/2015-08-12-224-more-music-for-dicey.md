In posts [#215](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/215-dicey/) and [#217](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/217-music-for-dicey/) I began detailing work on a dice-based brain training game called Dicey.

Work has continued, though I [hesitate to post](http://sandcastle.co/dicey/) this really rough first test draft Kevin is working on (it's a live testing link, so will be changing over time!).  Tonight I decided to try another shot at the music (ok a 4th shot).

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" style="margin-bottom:10px;" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219031612&amp;color=00aabb&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

More tweaks to come, but I like the direction itâ€™s headed in.
