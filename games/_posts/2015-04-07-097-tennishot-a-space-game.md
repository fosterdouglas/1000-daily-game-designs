Billiards + tennis + golf, in space!

Using a giant shotgun that’s loaded with a tennis ball, complete a low-G multi-directional course by reflecting your shot off of walls and obstacles, and eventually through a hole.

This is like pool, but without gravity, with a much more complex obstacles, and at 25 times the scale.

The ball has weak a magnet system inside of it, and if the course isn’t completed in a single shot, the ball will come to a stop suspended in air, and the next shot is taken from that spot.
