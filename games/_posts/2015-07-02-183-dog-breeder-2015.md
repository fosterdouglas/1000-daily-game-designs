An educational game that teaches how to help recognize and identify various dog breeds by sight. 

Even experts in the canine field often struggle to identify dog breeds of mixed-breed dogs.  This game would help anyone who has a deep interest in learning about dogs by teaching breed history and genealogy, and showing common traits and physical factors across a wide variety of dog breeds.

(Note: could be applied to cats. but why?)
