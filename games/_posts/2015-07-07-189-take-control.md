In this mental workout, the player is using a controller and is forced to change control schemes rapidly to accomplish the same task.

For example, one scenario might be a side-scrolling platformer where every 15 seconds the directional buttons shift one notch clockwise and the jump button shifts one button clockwise.  Another example could be a rhythm game like guitar hero where the input color “tracks” shift positions at certain points in the song.  Another simple example could be a first-person target shooting game where every bullet you shoot changes your aim, reload, and fire buttons on the controller.

(In retrospect, I suppose this might be slightly inspired by the awesome penguin flipping game found at [lumosity.com](http://lumosity.com) !)
