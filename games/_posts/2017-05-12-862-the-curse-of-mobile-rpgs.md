title: 862 The Curse Of Mobile RPGs
tags: game-design-topic

I’ve always struggled with long-form mobile games.  I think the problem is that, typically the way that I play portable games, I don’t often want to sit and play them for more than 45 minutes at a time.

So, when I’m playing something like *Final Fantasy* or *Xenoblade Chronicles*, in the moment I am enjoying it, but it can sometimes feel overwhelming when I think about the number of 45-min play sessions that it’s going to take to finish the game.  If it’s a standard 50-hour RPG, that 60-some play sessions at least.  And RPGs are best experienced in relatively shorter windows of time, typically because of story and learning curve challenges.

I’m sure I’m talking about something that’s barely a problem anyway, since there aren’t actually that many mobile long-form RPGs out there.  It’s just something interesting I’ve noticed.
