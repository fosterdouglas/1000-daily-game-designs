Play as a second-rate Japanese folklore hero named Jiraiya, possessing only the questionably useful ability to transform into a giant toad.

Set in New York, find the most bizarre situations imaginable that your giant toad powers can potentially aid with.  Attempt to resolve the issues, or forego the way of the honorable man-toad and leave a trail of slimey destruction in your wake.

Jiraiya must also face his worst fears when a group of his folklore hero peers arrive in town, more elegant and superior (and useful!) than him, in every way imaginable.
