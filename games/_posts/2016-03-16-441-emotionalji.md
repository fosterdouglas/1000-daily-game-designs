A game using the [emojiDice](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/440-emojidice/){:target="_blank"} from yesterday’s post.

This game uses the Faces set of emojiDice.  In this children’s game, players rolls any two dice from the pack.  On the result, it’s the player’s task to interpret and explain the complex emotion formed from the combination of the two rolled dice.  The game is best played with a parent or guardian’s assistance.
