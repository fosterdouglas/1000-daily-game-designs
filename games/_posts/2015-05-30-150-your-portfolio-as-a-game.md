title: 150 Your Portfolio As A Game
categories: experimental-game
---
I want to create a website portfolio that you explore as a video game.

The web user is taken through the presented portfolio works by navigating with a character in a top down environment.  As you wander around, you begin discovering pieces of the personâ€™s works.  Some of them are described more clearly than others, some are hidden, and some are unlocked by completing short quests or by using abilities.  The work would all be related to video games (obviously), and the point of this type of interaction would be to show the creativity and abilities of the person.
