title: 132 Procedurally Generated RPGs Using Books

This RPG uses book text as an input for its procedural algorithms. 

The books page and word count are used to determine length.  A robust algorithm identifies character names, locations, and objects.  Other data is mined from the text, such as punctuation, grammar, parts of speech, style, word and sentence length, and so on.

Each of these data points is used to craft the RPG, including: quest text, background tile art, character design, the battle system, music and audio, and control scheme.

If this proves too complicated or not fun at all, the book text could be limited to use only for generating monsters, or locations (although this is much too similar to the use of CDs in the *Monster Rancher* series).
