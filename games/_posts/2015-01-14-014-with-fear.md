This narrative / story-based game plays with the concept of fate, luck, fear, and choice, as it relates to the disintegrating life of a once successful attorney falling into poverty and homelessness.

The game takes place in real-time.  This means that each minute that goes by in the real world is a minute that goes by in the game. When the game is shut off, the story, and time, pauses.

The narrative takes place over the course of 11 months. The player is forced to endure circumstances that are out of their control, be on the wrong side of a few unlucky situations, as well as making key life decisions.

The gameplay might be similar to some of the scenes from Beyond: Two Souls (specifically, Iâ€™m thinking about that scene when Jodie has to beg for money by playing a guitar on the snowy streets), or it might be more similar to something like the TellTall narrative games.
