I think every teenage video gamer has at one time or another reached down for the handbrake in their car and pretended that the button on it shot missiles out of the front of the car.  

No?

Just me?

And my friend Eric, I found out recently.

I would love to see a small experience in VR where something like this were a reality.  Maybe it was a game where you had a junker car that you had to outfit with bizarre homemade weapons that were activated by pressing buttons like that, or your car horn, turn signal, or radio knobs.

Like a first-person *Twisted Metal* in VR with deeper customization for the cars.
