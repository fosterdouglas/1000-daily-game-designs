A suite of games to be experienced while enjoying your cup of tea.

Tea is, really, best enjoyed while doing nothing else. But sometimes life requires us to spice things up a little.

This set of games is designed to be played while enjoying a cup (or multiple cups) of tea.  The games would use various easy-to-find objects, like a deck of cards, coins, dice, credit cards, silverware, or other available items.
