A game about making friends on the playground.

Start as a kindergartener and work your way up to ultimately graduate from 5th grade in this friend-making sim.  Taking cues from games like *Persona* and Japanese dating sim games, this would focus on dialogue and relationships with other students at the school, but would have an additional focus on playing side games, participating in class, and in general being an adolescent.

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Uncharted 4: A Thiefâ€™s End*** and ***Steamworld Heist*** and ***Fire Emblem Fates Birthright*** ]
