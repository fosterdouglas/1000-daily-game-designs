This card game is quick and easy to learn. It uses a standard deck of cards, and is played by two people.  Each person draws six cards from a shuffled face-down deck.  Then, four additional cards are taken from the deck and placed face-up between the players, in 2 perpendicular rows and partially layered one on top of the other.  The players then take turns adding one card from their hand to any of the 4 directional piles, with the goal of making two aligning piles the same sum as the other two perpendicular aligning piles.

I'll include a visual when I can take a photo of the setup.
