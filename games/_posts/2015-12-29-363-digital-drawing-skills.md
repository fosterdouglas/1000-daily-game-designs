A game that uses the iPad and Apple Pencil to teach fundamental drawing skills.

Like an interactive version of those How To Draw books, but much more than that.  It would encourage repetition, and analyze the strokes and exercises of the user to suggest further study or push them in different directions to help growth.  The game would also encourage the student to use paper and pencil whenever possible, to test out the differences between physical and digital drawing.

(Thanks Madeleine!)
