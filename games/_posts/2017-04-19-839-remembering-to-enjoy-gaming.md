Here’s a short PSA…

Don’t forget that the reason we play games is to enjoy them.

Enjoyment can mean a lot of different things, and of course isn’t always defined by happiness or "fun" necessarily, but is its own category of an answer to "why am I doing this thing?"

When we are choosing which games to play (and buy!), and how much time we invest in them, remember this.
