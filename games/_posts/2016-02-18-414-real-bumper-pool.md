Like regular pool, but with bumpers.

The bumpers are magnetic and retract down into the pool table top.  The balls are also slightly modified to include weak magnetics inside of them, ideally without changing their weight, density, or feel much.

After each turn the pool table randomly generates a new layout for the players to adapt to.  Any bumpers that have a ball resting on top of them wonâ€™t be raised. The remaining bumpers are raised randomly.  As players hit balls, the magnets in the bumpers subtly affect the trajectory of the balls.

All other standard rules of pool apply.
