A game that my friend Eric and I made up a few years ago.

Each player takes 2 ping pong paddles, one in each hand.  Two balls are used, although feel free to get wild and use up to four balls. Start the game by hitting one or all of the balls. The balls can bounce off of anything in the room, including the floor.

Basically, it’s ping pong, but with almost no rules and double of everything.
