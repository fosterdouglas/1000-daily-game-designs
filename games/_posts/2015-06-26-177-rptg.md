Use tweets to collaborate with friends on a text-based role playing.

Join a 4-person clan, then explore and adventure with each other through @mentions, #hashtags, and replies.  Roll your character using a custom web tool, and generate your stat hashtags.  Example below of potential format (just using the D&D core stats, but it could be different/simpler):

"@clan #LevelNameHP"
"#strength_dexterity_constitution_intelligence_wisdom_charisma"
"#abilityorspell1 #abilityorspell2"
"(optional) #_ item1 #_ _item2 #_ _ _item3 etc"

@Rivendell #3Frodo89 #s4_d3_c9_i6_w1_c4 #sneak #forcemissile

Your stat hashtags are required in every post made in the game, as your remaining free characters used per tweet are your “Action Points” in a sense.  In the example above, 80 characters remain to be used for acting your turn.  clan names and character names must be 4 letters or more, so the maximum AP any character could have is 108 (this would be a weak character, indeed!).   You may carry items and have better abilities, at the cost of your Action Points (each additional item you carry must be preceded by a compounding number of underscores).  Everything you do to improve or modify your character will affect its available Action Points to act in the scenario.

(More thoughts on this to come!)
