title: 312 Escape From Alcatraz
categories: adventure-game, simulation-game
---
Play as one of the three famous Alcatraz convicts, but plot the escape your own way and with your own tools.

Trade with prisoners, earn favors, craft tools, gain respect, and most importantly, plan your escape!  Learn secrets and insights into the prison facility, exploit the weaknesses of the building, learn the patterns of the guards, or even convince some of them to help your escape attempt.

Iâ€™m picturing this as potentially procedurally/randomly generated prison layout, AI patterns, and exploits.  The game plays out over the course of about an hour.  Spend the first 45 minutes of it doing your prep work for the escape, and the final 15 minutes executing the maneuver!

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Persona 4: Dancing All Night*** and ***Victor Vran*** and ***Infamous: First Light*** ]
