A puzzle/brain game about rearranging a pianoâ€™s keys into the correct order.

The piano looks visually correct.  But as you click on each key of the piano, none of the notes are where they belong.  Rearrange them as quickly and correctly as you can.  Harder levels increase the size of the piano and the amount of randomness in the placement of the rearrangement.
