An audio-only story told through the use of spatial awareness and a virtual reality interface.

This experience uses an Occulus Rift, or something similar, primarily to track the player’s head movement. Spatial sound design and voice-recognition software tell a story that takes place entirely in a Living Room. 

The player can move their head, and respond with their voice to the conversation being had.  The game’s story dynamically changes depending on what the player says.
