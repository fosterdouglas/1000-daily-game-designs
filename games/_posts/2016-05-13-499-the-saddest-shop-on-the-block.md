A simulation game about that shop that nobody goes into, and how it could possibly still be in business even.

Own and run the neighborhood’s most eclectic and confusing business, as you navigate the ins and outs of sustaining a failing business.  Learn to attract more and more obscure customers, reduce overhead, streamline your employees, and eventually claim the coveted **Weirdest Place** award.
