A system in a game where you can Disagree with the game after you die.

In a meta example, maybe the game system is a character in the world, and it is messing with the player in what it is showing them and the results of actions. There is some chance for the player to call the game’s bluff, for example after your character dies to some situation.  Maybe the game altered some stuff, or took additional health from you hoping you wouldn’t notice, and if you success in calling its bluff you get some good bonus plus a resurrection from death. If you’re wrong, you lose something additional to the penalties of dying.  

It’s somewhat like a gamble, although there could be ways for the player to notice that the game might have altered some outcome or situation.
