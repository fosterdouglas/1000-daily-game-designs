Naughty Dog’s anxiously awaited *Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End* comes out this week.  Fourth installments of games (and movies?) have a surprising track record. *Final Fantasy IV* (*Final Fantasy II* in the U.S.) was and is a beloved entry, and *Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag* (though not technically the fourth overall game in the series) is held as one of the best of the 10 or more in their catalog. *Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare* is generally regarded as the best in the series and *Fallout 4* somehow managed to surpass gamers’ insane expectations after *Fallout 3*. *Halo 4*, *Metal Gear Solid 4*, *Resident Evil 4*, *Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*, *Street Fighter IV*, *Ultima 4*… the list literally goes on and on.

Honestly! What makes the #4 spot so lucky?  It manages to somehow rise from the ashes of the inevitably-hated* #3 entry, but stops just short of the never-asked-for #5.

I’m not sure.  But it’s something to think about.

(*I’m tempted to list all of the #3’s that have fallen short… it’d probably be faster to just list the #3’s out there that were actually good.)
