title: 744 On A Boat Without A Room
tags: adventure-game, walking-sim
---
A narrative experience where you play as a character that’s stuck on an overnight ferry without a room to stay in.

As you attempt to find a bed (or just sleep on the floor), explore the ferry, learn about the passengers and uncover a mystery happening on board.

The focus in this idea is on the realism of the interactions with the environment.  You can open the door to someone else’s cabin (if they left it unlocked), and they may react in a variety of different ways to this, depending on their personality and how you handle it.  You can steal from the concession stand.  You can jump off the side of the boat and end the game.
