Become a Webmaster or be a pawn in her story.

Each hour of the day, a different player is granted access (if eligible) to be the webmaster of the game for an hour.  They are in charge of every aspect of the web game that everybody else is playing.

The game itself is a challenging rouge-like game that consists of 6 levels and a single final boss.  As you play through, the webmaster has the power to change anything thats happening in any of the 6 levels.  Monster difficulty, loot, music, environment, and more are all controlled by the webmaster.  Itâ€™s the players against the master in this unique web experience.
