A Scrabble variant rule where all players are looking at the same letters once each round.

After all players have gone once, 7 or 8 letters are placed out in the middle of the table, and all players have 2 minutes to come up with the best word they can.  After time is up, the words are written down and compared. The player that created the highest value word, including the bonuses from placing it in its specific spot on the board, wins that round and places the word down.

The game then continues as normal, until all players have had a standard Scrabble turn, then a round of Scrabble Babble happens.
