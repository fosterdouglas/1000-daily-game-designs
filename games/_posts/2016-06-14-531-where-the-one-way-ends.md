A geo-game where treasure is hidden around cities.

Treasure is hidden, specifically **Where The One Way End**s.  If you’ve ever seen one of these, they’re incredibly interesting looking and fairly rare.  It’s the spot in a road system where a single one-way road births a second direction, transforming it into a two-way.

The nature of the treasure that’s located at this spot could vary; maybe its simply a QR-code, or maybe it’s something more unique or complex that can only be experienced in person (ideally that).
