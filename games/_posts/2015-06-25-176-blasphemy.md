title: 176 Blasphemy!

A party game about freedom of speech and the contempt for your fellow players’ sacred God or beliefs.

Each player is assigned a Reverence card: a God, deity, or belief card.  These represent what the player “believes in” while in possession of the card.  The goal of the game is to disprove each others’ beliefs while defending your own.  Each Reverence card has a set of beliefs, as well as at least one Blasphemy statement; a hole, inconsistency, or untruth tied to your Reverence card that will ultimately be its demise.  Players must ask smart questions and manage a collective knowledge of each of the Reverence cards in play, attempting to exploit their weakness and acquire them as a trophy of conquer.
