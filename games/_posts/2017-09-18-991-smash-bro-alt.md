A *Super Smash Brothers* alternative system where instead of % of damage or "stock" lives, the players are in a "tug of war" with each other.

Two-player only (maybe?!), but essentially there would be a single bar at the bottom of the screen, and as player 1 does damage, the bar pushes to the right, and as player 2 does damage the bar pushes to the left.

It might need to be a bit more nuanced and tweaked in some way, but the idea would be that either player can make a "come back" potentially, even if they’re very nearly losing.

How this system would play with the system of higher % damaged players are pushed further around the screen when attacked, I’m not totally sure.
