A game played using a standard 88-key piano.

Choose a chord type (Maj, Min, Maj7, etc) containing 3 notes minimum.  Begin at any one of the piano’s lowest 7 notes, and play that chord type in that key.  The next chord you play must use one of those notes as it’s base (and lowest tonal) note.

Black keys are worth +1, white keys are worth -1.  See how high you can score by the time you reach the other end of the piano!
