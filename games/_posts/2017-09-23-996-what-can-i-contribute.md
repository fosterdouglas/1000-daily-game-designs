What can I contribute?

This is a question that’s been rattling around in my head for years, essentially since completing grad school.

My personal conundrum is that, in the gaming industry, as it might be in many other trades, often someone must work their way up the corporate ladder to achieve a specific position that they’re looking to get to.  And there’s nothing wrong with that, the hard work and growth along the way is admirable.

But, I don’t think it’s for me.  I've tried my hand at corporate life, and it wasn’t for me. There may be a very small subset of gaming companies out there that would provide what I’m looking for: a flat structure, collaborative, growth-centric, adapting position. But that’s a tall order, and wouldn’t be easy to find.

So, instead of bashing my head against the wall, doing something I’m not interested in, as a means to an end to some position I think I might be interested in… it’s going to be best to instead forge my own path.

It won’t be easy, and it might not even work out at all. But it’s the best way that I can go about contributing what I’m best at and capable of to the industry.
