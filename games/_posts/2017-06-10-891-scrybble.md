I always thought it would be interesting if the game Scrabble could be less about who has the largest vocabulary, and more about building what you can with whatâ€™s given to you.  Of course, the game **is** about both things, but I think it could be interested if the former aspect could be mostly removed.

In this Scrabble variation, all of the latin letters are replaced with proprietary symbols.  The symbols would have to be a on-the-fly-learnable system of some sort, and would interconnect with one another to create "words" that could then be played on a board similar to regular Scrabble, and built upon in the same way.
