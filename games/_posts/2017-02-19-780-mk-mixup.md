A silly multiplayer mode of *Mario Kart*.

Players are randomly assigned different aspects of each others’ cars.  You might control the steering of your car, the gas of another player’s car, the brakes of another, and the item ability of another.

A certain event or item would "shock" everybody and swap change the layout of the controls again.

The goal would have to be something different than crossing a finish line, something you could attempt to work to achieve no matter what car you were controlling or were focused on.
