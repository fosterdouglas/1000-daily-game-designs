In this multiplayer game, each person controls a set of limbs or parts on the main character of the game, and everybody must work together to complete a specific goal.

A single player might be in control of one of the following: both arms, both legs, both eyes, both hands, the voice, both ears, and so on.  Each part must be accounted for, and the orchestration of all of them together is key to success.
