As I was watching someone play *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* on Twitch, I had a thought.

The faerie bottles are an interesting mechanic, because it's basically allowing the player an option of much more easily getting through bosses, with up to 3 free full heals. This has the nice benefit of making the game a bit more accessible for players who aren’t as experienced, or haven’t acquired some additional heart pieces or equipment.

It also creates an interesting tension because filling bottles with faeries means that the player is sacrificing the ability to bring other things with them into the situation, like a magic potion.
