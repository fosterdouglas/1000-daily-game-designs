title: 977 Arbitrary Game Size Limitation

A self-imposed game size development limitation.

For example, a modern game made to fit on a floppy disk. That’s 1.44mb of data (well, it was for a certain style of floppy disk anyway). That’s not a lot to work with, especially when we’re talking about the size that assets can be in modern games.

A lot of indie games use perceived limitations like these to inform visual design styles, like making a game look like a Gameboy game by adjusting sprite styles or color palettes. But, it’d be a much more interesting game design challenge to actually limit it to the size that a Gameboy game had to work with.
