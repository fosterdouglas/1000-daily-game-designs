A kids narrative/educational game about a group of mischievous pirates that accidentally lost all the letters of the alphabet.

Kids adventure through this game playing as Captain M. V. P. of the C.  Youâ€™re in charge of your ship, and a crew of pirates that all need help recovering the letters of the alphabet. The game uses primarily voice and audio, and teaches children the letters of the alphabet slowly and methodically over the course of their nautical adventure.
