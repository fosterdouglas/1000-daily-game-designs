An FPS where you buy bullets for a penny each, pay-per-bullet.

Or at the core of it, a system that the player knows how much each bullet costs them when they shoot it.

Metro 2033 did something like this (since the bullets in some cases were the actual currency of some of the underground tunnel towns).

Maybe this could be achieved by giving the player "unlimited" ammo, but each shot they take removes 1 gold or dollar or cent or simoleon from their total, which is prominently displayed. Basically youâ€™re shooting money instead of bullets (I think a gun in Borderlands does this actually).
