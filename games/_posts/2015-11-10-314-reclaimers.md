A game that helps promote responsible water usage in the home.

Using a piece of cheap hardware, automatically track your household’s water usage in a mobile/tablet application.  The application uses gamification, goals, competition, and informative learning to encourage best practices for your house’s water consumption.  Play simple water-usage games to compete against your neighbors, friends, or even your roommates or siblings within the same household.

(Alternatively to the proprietary hardware, you could manually enter your water usage each day if you have access to your water meter.)
