This side scrolling platformer morphs and adjusts as you run from left to right to the pulsing beat of electronic music.

While the screen is automatically scrolling, you have to keep up as bass beats and synth hits happen, causing various objects and platforms to appear or disappear.  There would be a little or no punishment for missed jumps, slip ups, and mistakes; however, there is great reward for consistency, flow, and well timed actions.

The game is essentially a mix of Bit.Trip Runner, Rez, Sound Shapes, and Dyad.

(Inspired by Kaskade's [remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKcy-LiAFWU "Remix") of Rinzler from the TRON: Legacy soundtrack)
