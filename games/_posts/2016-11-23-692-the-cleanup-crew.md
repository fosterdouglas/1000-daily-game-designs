Who cleans up the mess that game protagonists leave behind?

I’ve been playing a lot of the *Dishonored* series lately.  It has me wondering… all these people that I’ve choked into a peaceful sleep, what happens to them? Do they wake up eventually? Does somebody stumble across them before that? Do they remember what happened?

And if I played in a more violent style, who deals with all of the blood and massacred corpses left behind?

This meta game is about those people, the ones who clean up behind the heroes and villians of our favorite games.

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Dishonored 2*** and ***Battleborn*** and ***NomNomGalaxy*** ]
