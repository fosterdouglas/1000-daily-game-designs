Can we design our game AI to have curiosity? Is curiosity something you can program?

Thatâ€™s kind of an insanely large question, with implications far beyond gaming.  But it is something interesting to think about.  I was watching the game Planet Coaster streaming recently, and it raised this question in my mind.  All the individuals in the game that visit the theme park, can they have curiosity while they make decisions ("decisions") about what to do in the park?  Can they be interesting in things, and grow as little AI entities within the game? Can they be influenced by decisions that their peers make, by advertisements, and other non-direct factors outside of the "price" and "fun" of a ride?

That would be pretty awesome.
