In this simple quiz, input all of the cities that you’ve ever visited (big, medium, or small!) for more than just a few minutes.  Once submitted, the quiz generates a score of how "cultured" you might be based on the cities.

It may also be a lead-in test for a set of customized quizzes that question your knowledge of the places in the world you’ve already been to.
