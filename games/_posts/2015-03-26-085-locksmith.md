A full-featured lock picking simulation game.

Go from amateur door locks to a world-class thief with this realistic lock simulator and educational tool.  This game uses advanced VR features and haptic gloves (which may or may not actually be available yet), as well as a proprietary piece of hardware that helps to simulate many different types of locks and situations. It would probably be very expensive, and super niche. But cool!
