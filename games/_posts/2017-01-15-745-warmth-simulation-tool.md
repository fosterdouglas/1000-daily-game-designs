I love that there is a Wikipedia article for this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_clothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_clothing){:target="_blank"}

So, why canâ€™t it also be a game?

In this game-making tool, objects (like clothing) can be given properties that affect how the environment permeates them.  Likewise, characters (that is, objects that have these other objects attached to them) can react to these changes.

So, for example, your character is wearing a thick coat, and the environment they are in is set as very cold; your character is not comfortable, but they are warm enough to survive and function.  If they walk inside a very warm house, and leave the coat on, they become extremely uncomfortably warm.  If the coat is removed, they slow normalize.  If they then walk back outside without the coat on, they quickly become extremely uncomfortably cold.  

This system could be utilized well in realistic 3D games that are focused on player immersion.
