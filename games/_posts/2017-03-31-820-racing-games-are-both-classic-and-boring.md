title: 820 Racing Games Are Both Classic And Boring

What is it about racing games?

The big ones, *Gran Turismo* and *Forza* are truly masterpieces of their niche.  It’s awe-inspiring the amount of meticulous detail that these teams have with cars and racing. Classic and beautiful.

But at the same time, aren’t they kind of boring?

Since the goal often is realism, it’s not often that a ton of new and radical things can be added.  Updated cars and engines and visuals and sounds, yes.  And deeper more accurate physics.  But in the end, it’s still a racing game.

I wouldn’t say it’s **just** a racing game, because that’s demeaning.  And I’ve in the past greatly enjoyed a few of the *Gran Turismo* games, for sure.

I guess if we’re comparing this to classic [sports games](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/793-sports-franchise-pricing/){:target="_blank"}, at least racing games aren’t released **yearly**. ;)
