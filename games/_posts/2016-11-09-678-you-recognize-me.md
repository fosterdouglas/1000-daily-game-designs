A flip on [a previous post](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/650-i-recognize-you/){:target="_blank"}, where the goal was to avoid people you know in a cafe simulation game.

In this version (or mode of that original game), instead you **are** the person that people are trying to avoid.  Itâ€™s your job to find and interact with even more obscure and random people from your past, preventing them from enjoying their quiet cafe experience.
