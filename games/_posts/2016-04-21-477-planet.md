Plan and reorganize a planet.

Play "god" in this planet simulation game. Like *Sim Earth* and the *Civilization* series, but less focused on micromanaging.  Plant elements like prehistoric bacteria, simple animal groups, geological elements and minerals, bodies of water, rock formations, and other basic planet elements.

Then run your simulation and observe the evolution and outcome. Tweak variables, zoom in and out of sections of the planet, and refine your planet with modifications and enhancements.  Attempt to create a planet ecosystem that eventually successfully evolves into a thriving civilization.

(Thanks Madeleine!)
