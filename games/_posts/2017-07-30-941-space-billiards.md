Zero-gravity pool.

The game would be played in a small square or rectangle room. All eight of the corners of the room would contain large pockets, and potentially a few others along the walls mimicking a standard pool table.

The players stand in the room, ideally anchored to the floor somehow. The room has zero-gravity, and so all of the pool balls are floating. Most of the rest of the rules from billiards apply, as players take turns hitting pool balls into various pockets.
