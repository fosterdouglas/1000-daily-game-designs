A full-featured tree growing simulator.

Not a game, but to be used for realism in games.  This system simulates from birth to death the processes of a tree.  It takes into account the tree species, climate, rain, sunlight, time, soil, humidity, moisture, nearby trees, and so on.  All of these factors create a realistic sense of presence for the tree, or forest if a large group is made.

Something like this might already exist.
