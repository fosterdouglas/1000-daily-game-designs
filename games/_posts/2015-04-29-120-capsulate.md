A puzzle game with rotating, expanding, and contracting capsules.

Each square in the grid can be rotated 90 degrees with a single tap. Capsules are created by connecting similarly colored segments together. Tap and hold on a capsule with at least one middle segment to clear it from the board.  Each time a capsule is cleared, all columns grow upward by one square.  Capsules can only be cleared if both ends are capped and visible.
