Stack odd and mis-shapen boxes and appliances into a U-Haul moving truck. 

Within a 3D environment, stack boxes into the truck by moving, rotating, and flipping the incoming items.  Itâ€™s not a timed game, but efficiency is rewarded.  The goal is to be able to fit all the required items into the truck.  Efficient space usage is also rewarded.

As the levels progress, the sizes of trucks will increase, as well as the strangeness and variation in size and shape of the boxes and appliances.  It will also become increasingly more difficult to successfully fit everything into the truck.
