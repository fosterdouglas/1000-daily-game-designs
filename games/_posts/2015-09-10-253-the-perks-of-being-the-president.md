A role-playing game as the President of the United States.

Do all the things a president does, in this life sim.  First campaign to become President, and then fulfill your daily duties by: avoiding all-out war with the entire world, visiting leaders of foreign countries, make important decisions, veto stuff, don’t veto stuff, fly around in your helicopter, give epic speeches, take photos, and keep the peace.

Fail and your country won’t like you.  Do something illegal and they may even impeach you.  With great power (and money) comes great responsibility.
