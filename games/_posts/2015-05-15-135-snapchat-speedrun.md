In this social game, you are challenged by a friend to do something completely within the span of the time of a single Snapchat message.  For example, “slice an apple into 8 pieces” or “meet 3 strangers.”  The challenger poses the challenge and the reward, and the person’s other (hopefully impartial) followers vote on whether they succeeded at the challenge or not.
