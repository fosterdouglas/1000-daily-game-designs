A relationship game about speaking your mind at the right time.

Context and timing can be crucial in conversation, especially if the topic is sensitive or difficult to talk about.  In this experimental game, use timing and intuition to decide the most appropriate time to bring up a certain topic. Listen carefully to your conversation partner, get a sense of how they are feeling and what headspace they are in.  Find the precise moment to say what needs to be said, and then choose the right way to say it.

"It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it."
