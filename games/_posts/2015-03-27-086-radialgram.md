A circular version of the classic Nonogram puzzles.

The numbers for each column are laid out around the edges of the board, and work in the classic Nonogram style (each number in a column corresponds to the number of unbroken filled in squares, with at least a single empty square between each of those numbers listed for that column).  Thereâ€™s one column that runs through the puzzle that has a single number corresponing to each row, that tells only the total number of filled in squares in that circumference row, without regard to spacing or empty squares.
