In this time-twisted take on *Magic: The Gathering*, players must “UnFight” key battles in *MTG* history to regain lost artifacts and learn the truth about their character's past.

Each game starts at the point of one person being one move away from winning.  From here, the game is played precisely backward. Instead of drawing cards, you surrender them each turn. UnTap mana, UnDamage enemies, and retract creatures turn-by-turn.  The ultimate goal is to reach your 20 point health max before the opposing player does themselves.
