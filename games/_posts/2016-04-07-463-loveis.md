A game/app about people sharing what "love.is" to them.

The concept of love is incredibly complex, contextual, and sometimes conceptual.  The word means many different things to different people and situations, but we often share the word with many different people in our lives.

In this app, post snippets, describing what love means to you. Post them when it strikes you, save and revisit them, or browse a feed of what it is that love means to others around the world.
