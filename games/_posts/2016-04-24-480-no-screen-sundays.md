Today I did an experiment.

The idea is to spend less time in front of technology.  So, I've designed a system to completely shut off my tech devices for a single day.  It’s either once a week, or a few times a month, something entirely dependent on my schedule and commitments.

(I’m using Sundays because it works best in general with my work schedule, as well as for other reasons.)

On Saturday night, when you would otherwise plug in your phone and turn on your alarm for the next morning, instead turn off your phone completely.  Put it in a drawer somewhere, completely out of sight.  Go find an old school alarm clock that you probably have buried in some closet that you never open, and set it.  Do any other prep work the evening before to prevent **any** other usage of other devices like TVs, tablets, computers, etc. The best way to avoid accidentally using these is to put them away; out of sight, out of mind.

Wake up in the morning, and enjoy your tech free day.  I personally find it to make most sense to run this as a "sunrise to sunset" system, rather than midnight-to-midnight or a strict 24-hour limitation.  Around 8pm, after dinner, feel free to slowly introduce yourself back into our modern world of tech.

Feels nice to take a breather, doesn’t it?
