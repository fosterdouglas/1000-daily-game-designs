This is a real Wikipedia article:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reportedly_haunted_locations_in_the_San_Francisco_Bay_Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reportedly_haunted_locations_in_the_San_Francisco_Bay_Area){:target="_blank"}

This could be an adventure game where players explore these specific locations throughout a narrative, based in the Bay Area.  

But not a scary game or a horror game, because those are stressful and awful.  Just a bit mysterious or creepy.
