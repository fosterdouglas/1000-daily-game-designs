A game designed to use your eyes against you.

This game would feature many visual illusions and optical trickery, converted into game and puzzle mechanics.  Mechanics would play with object scale and positioning, visual deception, motion within static images, reflections, and color.  Each beginning puzzle is focused around one of 10 or so concepts; later puzzles become more difficult by combining these concepts together.
