title: 574 A Gradual Skill Tree

Skill trees are pretty much defined by their "monuments" or leaps of skill the player can choose from, every so often. This system would instead use more gradual change.

For example, the player may still choose major landmark skills from the tree, but as their character gains experience, the usefulness and effect of that skill evolves.  Maybe a skill that says "gain 10hp" increases to 11, then 12, and so on.  All behind the scenes while the game continues on.

In life, we don’t reach "monuments" in most things we study or do.  I don’t suddenly jump up in skill while I’m learning italian.  It’s a slow and steady progress, but a month later when I look back, I’m much further than where I started.
