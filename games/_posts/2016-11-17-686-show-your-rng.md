I was watching a video recently (that was completely over my head) about RNG in video games.  It’s a complex topic that I won’t claim to known much about, other than the general sense of how it works. Basically, games calculate random numbers for when things happen by chance.  Whatever it might be, an item dropping, an event occurring, etc.  It all happens using this tech called an RNG.

It would be cool if a game were to show off that technology, instead of hiding it.  Like, the player could see the RNG right as it’s happening.  Kind of like dice rolling in physical board games.
