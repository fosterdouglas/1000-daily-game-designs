I like the idea of games being more musically dynamic, even if they aren’t in the "music game" genre.

For example, if it were a Mario game, maybe every coin that mario picks up is a specific timbre of sound effect depending on which part of the current music track it’s at.  And, those notes are quantized to happen right on the main downbeats of the track.  And, of course in the same key as the song that’s on.  

I think something as simple as this (ok, it’s not that simple, I know interactive audio design is intensely difficult!) could make a big difference in the polish and vibe of a game.
