I’ve always loved skill trees in games.  I don’t know what it is about them… the options, the potential, the forced decision making… I love it.

I’d love to see an evolved skill tree that is designed visually to better represent the difficulty/importance/cost of each node in the tree.  Especially because typically, at least in complex RPGs, the skill trees can get large and daunting and complicated to navigate.  There must be a way to lay it out that retains it’s forced linearity while encouraging ease-of-use and visual style.
