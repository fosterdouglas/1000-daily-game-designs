Play the role of The Overbearing Boyfriend (or girlfriend).

In this game, you can’t help but be an extremely overbearing significant other.  Your goal is to satisfy your own deranged compulsion to be overbearing, without pushing your partner away too much.

It would essentially be a meter monitoring style game, watching how various meters react to the decisions you make.  Unfortunately, that’s not particularly realistic since people don’t have meters attached to their foreheads that describe how they’re feeling.
