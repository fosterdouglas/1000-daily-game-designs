A game played through controller vibration only.

The player is taught a variety of vibration patterns, speeds, and intensities.  Then they must navigate an extremely obscured 3D space, primarily using environmental vibration responses as well as audio cues. A few examples of vibrations the player would need to recognize or memorize:

- Short and repetitive
- Lengthy and strong
- Patterns incorporating those two alternating
- A pulse or wave of constant
- Extremely fast and staccato
- Soft, barely felt
