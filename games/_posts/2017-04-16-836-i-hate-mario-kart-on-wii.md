Is this a popular opinion? I’m not sure.

I revisited this game recently with a few friends.  It’s really bad.

And not in that weird way that playing older games can be.  That’s different.

This is the *Mario Kart* where they forced you to use motion steering controls to play.  Yeah, that one.

Was this ever fun for anyone?  Did people ever enjoy this?

Of course they did because *Mario Kart* is inherently good at bringing people together and creating laughs and fun.  But come on Nintendo; that’s not an excuse for making a crappy game.
