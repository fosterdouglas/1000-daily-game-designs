A game that you play using both your computer and your iPad next to each other.

I picture this as a puzzle or action-y game, but I think it could probably be most anything.  Basically, the game syncs itself to your iPad (however that might work…), and then acts as a second screen.  While this isn’t particularly revolutionary, it’s not typically done with two screens next to each other.  I think this could introduce a lot of interesting mechanics that play with the separate spaces, and how they interact with each other.

It’s kind of like a giant sideways DS.
