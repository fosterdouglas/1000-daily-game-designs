An entire game system designed around the realistic simulation of wood burning.

For those of us not lucky enough to own a real fireplace or fire pit, this game allows accurate simulation from the comfort of your home TV! The game would feature dozens of types of wood, various flame-lighting mechanisms, and various settings (campfire, fireplace, etc).  Logs could be added at any time to the fire and placed precisely where desired.  The physics would react accurately, even allowing the player to accidentally snuff out of suffocate the fire without the proper attention.  An auto mode is also available that will keep the fire optimally burning without any required input. This could potentially be an augmented reality or VR experience.
