A *Grand Theft Auto* game that doesn’t give the player unrealistic freedoms.

For example, if you get arrested, it’s game over. Or, the game turns into a prison simulation game with no escape (obviously nobody would continue playing in this case, there’s no way to actually escape other than to serve your multi-year sentence, which might take 100s of in-game hours).

The fact that I can just pay a few thousand dollars to escape jail is precisely what enables the majority of bizarre and reckless behavior in *Grand Theft Auto*. And that’s fine, that’s a lot of fun for people. But from the perspective of creating something that’s a little more nuanced and balanced, there could definitely be some room for experimenting with what happens with the jail system.
