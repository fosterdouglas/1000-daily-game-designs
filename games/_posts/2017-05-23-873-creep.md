A silly mod for *Minecraft* where you play as the Creeps.

It could be a competitive style game, like *Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare*, where one set of players is the Creeps, and the other set is normal *Minecraft* characters.  Or, it could be that you just play a single Creep, and the regular characters are NPCs.

Also, the entire soundtrack would be remixes and versions of Radioheadâ€™s "Creep" track.
