I’ve always been fascinated by how memory works.  Specifically, how we recreate past memories.  It’s rare that we recall things precisely how they happened, and it’s been shown that we may even "rewrite" our memories (to use a computer analogy) each time we access them, altering them slightly each time. In this narrative/experimental game, memory is explored in depth, using the idea of decaying.
