A narrative experiment with nameless characters.

In this experimental narrative idea, a traditional visual/interactive story is told, except that character names and labels are absent.  The main character and all people they interact with are nameless in the writing. They aren’t actually nameless in the narrative’s world, and the focus isn’t set on the fact that they aren’t referenced by any name.  It’s merely an experiment to see if a narrative can be crafted without names.
