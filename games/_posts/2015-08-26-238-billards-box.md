Classic billiards with a twist.

A pool table contained within a room the size of the pool table + the length of a pool stick on each side.  The roomâ€™s walls have hundreds of intricate physical protrusions that impede the player from holding and using the pool stick easily in most cases.

The rules are the same, but the challenge is figuring out how to actually hit your ball.  Different angles, bounces, and strategy must be used in order to claim the title of Billiard's Box king!
