An educational game that helps you exercise your ear for foreign languages.

It’s my belief that a lot of things we do (and learn) in life can be more automatic than we realize.  In this game, use your lack of knowledge of a foreign language to test your on-the-fly comprehension and context learning.

The game would put you in a virtual room with NPCs speaking in conversation to one another.  You are there only to listen.  It’s your task to figure out what conversations are going on, using context clues and careful listening and studying.  Each conversation group can be rewound and listened to again.

Maybe there’s a "decoding" system, where once you know for sure a certain word or phrase, you can input its translation and it gets replaced with your native language when it’s spoken in the conversation.
