A variation on the game of American football that allows each team to have only a single "down" per possession.

Players line up at their own 20-yard line and have one play to score before the team gets to try.  All sense of strategy is stripped from the game, making it essentially all about the **hail-mary**. It probably wouldnâ€™t be that fun of a game, actually.  But it may be interesting to see once.
