A story about physical media, and its inherently fragile nature.

For example, maybe a VHS tape that the protagonist needs to play often, or has a compulsion to play. But, they know that its quality degrades each time they play it.

There would need to be some legitimate reason that it couldn't just be duplicated, maybe that the time period it's in no longer has technology that can duplicate tapes. Or, there just arenâ€™t any excess tapes available. The gameplay could be tied into this, maybe looking for (and scarcely finding) new tapes to duplicate the media to is a primary drive.
