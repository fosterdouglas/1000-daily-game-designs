This sequel to [Vowel Quest](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/407-vowel-quest/){:target="_blank"} has significantly more condensed, intense, and challenging level designs.  Similar rules to *Vowel Quest*, except that the consonants are now the enemies, and the vowels used to generate the level constraints.
