This is a walking sim game, except the entire time one of your hands is occupied by your phone.

The player has to decide what is more interesting, what’s going on around them, or what’s going on with the phone in their hand.  There is narrative, addictive mini-games, photos, chats, calls, and other interactions to be done on the phone.

The inclusion of cell phones in games has been on the rise, but it’s most often used as a menu system or as a gateway to controlling the location of the in-game character.  I haven’t seen it used as an actual primary component of gameplay yet.
