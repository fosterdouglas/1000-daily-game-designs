A comical chef simulator game featuring increasingly picky eaters.

In this game, you're an aspiring chef that moved to a new city that you don't know much about.  You're excited to start your new restaurant and meet/feed the locals.

After setting up shop, it begins to occur to you that the people in town are not as they seem. As in, they are absolutely out of their minds.  They're the world's most pickiest customers, AND IT'S YOUR JOB TO CONQUER THEIR COMPLEX TASTE BUDS.
