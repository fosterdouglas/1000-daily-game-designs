title: 882 Cry Of Fear Health System
tags: game-mechanic-system

I was recently watching Vinesauce steam *Cry of Fear* and was interested in one of the health systems in the game.  As it is, I rarely agree with how unrealistic "health packs" and "hit points" and "HP" and "life" is… but in this game, the character is essentially injecting adrenaline to keep himself going through some pretty tough situations.  Each shot of adrenaline that he takes reduces his maximum "health bar" a tiny bit, and *i think* that also sometimes taking damage from enemies also decreases this maximum slightly.

I didn’t see how this progressed over the course of the entire game, and I’m sure the game built in some mechanic or "healing" that would allow the player to regain some of that lost maximum, but in general this system is a step in an interesting direction.
