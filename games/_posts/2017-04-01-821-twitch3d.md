A *SecondLife*-ishy experience happening concurrently while using Twitch.

In this experience, you create simple avatars for a streaming service like Twitch.  You can then walk around between your favorite streamers, in a 3D "world."  Each streamer and some of its audience could be seen gathered around the streamer and the screen as you walk up to it.  Then, if you "sit down" at the stream, it zooms to the traditional fullscreen experience, with chat functionality. 

Maybe itâ€™s a little too "Nintendo," but there could also be mini-games that the players could interact with or compete in against others.  Also, obviously, this could work with VR.
