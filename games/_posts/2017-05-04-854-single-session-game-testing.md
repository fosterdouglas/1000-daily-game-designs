title: 854 Single Session Game Testing
tags: game-design-topic

Recently, Eric and I played an entire game in a single sitting, *Gears of War Judgement*.  As far as I know, games arenâ€™t generally designed to be played this way.  It got me thinking though, about how game companies test longer form games like this.

I wonder if they ever have testers run through the game in a single session, to see how interacting with the game in a non-stop way like that affects the decisions and skill at the game.  I would hypothesize that it makes a pretty significant difference in those things, as well as how the story is absorbed and understood.
