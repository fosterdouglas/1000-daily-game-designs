An educational game of being more outgoing when it matters most.

This VR game puts you in a wide variety of social situations to test your ability to be outgoing.  Primary, this experience would be geared toward people who aren’t already exceedingly outgoing.

Situations could include an interaction in a bar, club, restaurant, at a mutual friends’ party, a baby shower, the in-law’s house, on an airplane, and so on.  The game encourages you to say and do things that cultivate new relationships and that encourage people to want to interact with you further.
