title: 973 Difficulty Over Time

Game difficulty is a topic of contemporary game discourse much more than it was in the past.

While trying to think of this in graph form, I came up with the following thought:

Difficulty is (relatively) finite but time is (mostly) infinite.

What I mean is, there are technically limits to how difficult something can be because there are limits to what the human body and mind can (or wants) to do. And there are technically no limits to how much something can be done for.

Player preference is also a huge factor of this, as there will rarely be a single difficulty graph that applies to all variety of player preference.

Overall this needs more thought.
