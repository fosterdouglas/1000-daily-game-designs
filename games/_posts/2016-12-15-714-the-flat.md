A puzzle/mystery game set inside of an apartment.

I like the idea of extremely detailed and condensed areas of video games.  A good example of this was *Gone Home*, the puzzle/story game released in 2013.  The entire game took place inside of a single (but fairly large) house.

In this game, the space is even more condensed.  But the detail is exponential.  Every drawer and cabinet is full of things to interact with.  Every window opens, the TVs turn on and the remotes work, the books on the bookshelves are real books that can be read from beginning to end.  

Itâ€™s like Secondlife in some ways, but hyper compressed.  I think this could make a great environment and setup for a really interesting story.
