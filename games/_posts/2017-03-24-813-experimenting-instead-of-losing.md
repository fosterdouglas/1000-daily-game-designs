[Yesterday’s post](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/812-the-incredible-machine/){:target="_blank"} got me thinking more about educational games.

What I loved about *The Incredible Machine* was that "losing" a level just constituted your solution to the machine not working out entirely.  But that "losing" was a part of winning.  Which means it wasn’t losing, it was **experimenting**.  And that’s awesome.

There are a ton of games now that still do this.  Even if there is "death" or clear "losing" built into the game’s mechanic, it’s often contextualized or approached in a way that enforces a learning aspect.  I love this, and I hope the design trend continues this way.

Of course, there are [exceptions](http://playunfairmario.net){:target="_blank"}; games that are specifically designed to test resolve, patience, and tenacity.  Ooof.
