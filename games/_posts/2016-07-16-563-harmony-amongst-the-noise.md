An audio game about identifying clashing music.

There’s something innately unsettling about hearing two songs play at the same time. In this game, that’s all you get.  Listen carefully to discern which lyrics belong to which song, and identify other aspects of the separate tracks.

A similar post was made a few months ago, [412 The Loudest Dentist](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/412-the-loudest-dentist/){:target="_blank"}.  This one is more about the noise that’s created when two songs are playing simultaneously, not the noises in our lives that prevent us from hearing music clearly.
