I was (was? is? am…) a massive fan of *Mini Metro*, an incredibly addicting Steam/iOS/etc game that was released in the last year or two.  Essentially, it’s a minimalistic train route planning simulator.  It did a lot unique things and innovation within the broader simulator genre.

I think a potential expansion on this idea into bus systems could be really interesting.  A train system is somewhat more strict in its utility after it’s built… trains can go on that track and only that track.  A bus system on the other hand, is using roads that already exist, thousands of options and adjustments in a given city for routes to be made most efficiently.

The minimalist approach might not fit this as well because of that deeper complexity, but I think it could be an interesting direction or next step after a game like *Mini Metro.*

After some digging, and a suggestion from Kevin, I found that [this](https://www.remix.com){:target="_blank"} already exists.  Not a game, but still pretty cool.
