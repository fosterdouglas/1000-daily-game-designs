I don’t mean physically.

Well, you can if you want. ;)

I’ve talked about it [before](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/760-information-offloading-maps/){:target="_blank"} a bit, but I think there is, in *some cases* a defense for why games have slowly automated or simplified certain systems, leading to a "hand-holdy" effect.

When done properly, the reason systems are automated is because that information offloading allows the game to explore more interesting and deep mechanics, without alienating the audience or asking them to invest dozens of hours into learning your game before being able to actually enjoy it.

For example, in *Diablo 3*, there are a ton of systems in place to make playing the game as easy as possible.  Not that the skill it requires is low, or that the fun is low, but that the systems will "hold your hand" in a way that helps them become transparent and helps you as the player enjoy your time with the game as much as possble.

Ultimately, it comes down to the game designer deciding if they want to cater to a niche audience or a broader one.  If you find your niche audience, and they’re excited about your game, then they’ll take the time to learn your game.  If you want a more generalized "one size fits most" approach, then adding some elements of "hand holding" can be a smart way to go.
