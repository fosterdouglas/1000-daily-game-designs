categories: gamification, social-game

A gamification system that makes your mind-numbingly boring job slightly more bearable. 

Company’s could implement a system that rewards and encourages employees to stay on task, and focus their energy during work.  The system would have experience points (although it might not use this term, to be more appealing to gamers and non-gamers alike), trophies, social aspects, and rewards.  Things like meeting deadlines early, interacting positively with fellow employees, completing extra training during down time, and other self-motivated initiatives would gain the employee experience points, which could be “spent” on a variety of different things, either real or digital.
