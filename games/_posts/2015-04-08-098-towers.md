A multiplayer tower defense game where each player controls a single tower, in first person view.

The player focuses on upgrading their own tower, however the ultimate goal is to fit into the overall team, and to strategize together with the other towers to be prepared to defeat waves of different types of opposition.

The tower would be more of a management game, where the player needs to build different areas of their tower that do different abilities, make sure they are prepared and stocked for the battle, upgrade parts, and repair when needed.
