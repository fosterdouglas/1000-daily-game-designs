The officially licensed spin-off adventure card game from the minds that brought you Underground.

In this card game, you create stacks of summons that chain together chosen abilities, while sacrificing other abilities.  The stacks go up against locations from the video game, which have villains beneath them.  The stacks of summons must defeat the villains to reclaim locations and help protect Londonâ€™s Underground tube system.
