A brain game that tests your memory and recall.

The game asks you do multiple things rapidly in a row at your illustrated residence, then you leave your character’s house and the game distracts you with an unrelated task, and then asks you a series of “Did I?” questions:

“Did I… remember to lock the front door?"
“Did I… leave the windows down in my car?"
“Did I… feed the cat her wet food or dry food?"
“Did I… leave the bathroom light on?"

The game may also ask you a series of follow up questions after each question to determine how much detail you recall about that specific task you did (or didn’t do).

(Thanks Kevin!  Now, quit leaving your windows rolled down during flash flood tsunamis.)
