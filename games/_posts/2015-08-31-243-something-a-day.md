Instead of making a game design each day, make a game that has a system that allows content to be created for it, and create something daily for it.

For example, if it were a puzzle game, once the gameâ€™s mechanics and interaction is determined, the pieces could be used each day to make a new challenge.  If it were an RPG, maybe final assets could be used to create different versions of various areas each day.  If it were a first-person shooter, maybe level layouts could be created each day and somehow easily applied on the fly to the actual game build.
