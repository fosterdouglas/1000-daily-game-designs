I think there's an interesting divide between designing physical games and digital games. When you're designing something physical, say for example Monopoly, there are inherit restrictions. Physically speaking, you just can't do certain things.  The ultimate complexity of the game will be, in some ways, limited.  You can't have thousands of pieces, keep track of mounds of data, or have much deep automatic feedback.  It's not bad though, these things are what define physical games.

Digital games have their own set of limitations, certainly.  For Hay, I've been thinking a lot about this.  The game is in many ways similar to Chess.  But Chess is physical game, and *Hay* is digital.  And while the two forms share a common language, they aren't cut out for the same purpose.

Just more to think about.
