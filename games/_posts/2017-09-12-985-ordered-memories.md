A game about putting a collection of memories in order.

I imagine it to be something like Life is Strange in some ways, but the player would be experiencing vignettes of a characterâ€™s memories in some non-linear order, and the gameplay would be during those memories as well as outside of them to piece them together in some way. It also feels a bit like it could have a vibe like Heavy Rain in some way.
