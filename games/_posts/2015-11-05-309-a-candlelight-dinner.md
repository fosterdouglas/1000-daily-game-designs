Your goal is to prepare to host a romantic dinner this evening; you have 3 hours to get everything prepared for it.

However, doing certain activities before or after others affects how quickly they can be accomplished.  Also, there are more things to do than there is time to do them.  Prioritizing which of these things gets done affects how well the dinner date goes.

For example, six things you could do, in no particular order:

- Take a shower / get presentable
- Begin dinner
- Prepare entertainment / music / movie
- Go shopping for wine
- Clean up your house
- Do the dishes

If, for example, you waited until last to go shopping for the wine, you may 1) end up with wine that isnâ€™t chilled properly before serving and 2) potentially cause yourself to be late for your own dinner party.  If you chose to take a shower and dress yourself nicely before doing your dishes, you risk splashing and ruining your outfit.

This is a simple example, if there were 10 or more slots of time available, and 15+ potential activities to finish, the strategy may get particularly interesting.
