A system of permanent consequence in characters.

In this system, while your character continues to gain abilities and skills as they level up, they are also susceptible to permanent ailments, injuries, and handicaps from their decisions and situations throughout the game.

In some strategy games (like *XCOM*), there is a system to make characters temporary unavailable to use because they are in a state of "healing," and after a certain amount of time passes, the character is available again.  However, there are no permanent consequences for this.

This system would impart permanent (even if they were small) consequences on your character based on your performance in the game.
