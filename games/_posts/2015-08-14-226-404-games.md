Websites should be more fun.

404 and 500 error pages should have micro games on them.  Something like the games Google does on their homepage from time to time.  A *Space Invaders* clone, *Pac-Man*, poker, or even *Pong*.  It would at least cushion the sadness when you visit a bookmarked website only to find that its page has been moved or deleted. 

Maybe it can be a **Web 3.0** standard. ;)
