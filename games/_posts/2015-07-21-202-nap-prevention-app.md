An application that guides you through a short nap-reduction sequence.

Nap Prevention (NP) is a serious thing.  Sometimes your body is on the verge of auto-nap, but you know that you have other things you need to be doing first. If you arenâ€™t able to get in some quick aerobic exercises or pound back an espresso-red-bull energy shot concoction, fire up NP and get yourself in the zone.

NP uses engaging audio, visuals, interactivity, games, and really just about any cheap trick it takes to get you out of your nap-funk and through the rest of your miserable day.  Never fall asleep accidentally again, with NP!
