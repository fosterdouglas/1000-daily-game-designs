A mechanic where the food you eat during the day is a significant source of your energy and stamina.  If eating is ignored, much like in real life, performance will suffer.  What you eat also affects how you sleep, which in turn affects your performance ability the following day.

Sleeping is also hugely important.  As the day winds down and the sun sets, a player may start to see their character move more slowly, miss their attacks more often, and generally seem more unfocused and struggle to concentrate.  This can be temporarily combated with caffeine and certain other drugs, but will create consequences later on, by inhibiting the ability to sleep.
