Here we are, **seven hundred and thirty-three** posts into this crazy experiment… and it’s time for a face lift!  A major one!

I’ve been wanting to do this for quite a while, and Kevin and I finally got around to making it happen.  I took some time to do solid designs for what I wanted the site to achieve moving forward, and he developed it like a PRO.

So, I’ll be defocusing the site away from my projects, and really focusing on the game posts for now.  We’re adding a few other fun features like a randomize button and share-to-twitter link, as well as a easier-to-use archive view for viewing all the posts.  

I’ll attach a screenshot below, although it’s not so necessary since the updates are already pushed live and you can just go EXPLORE it yourself!
