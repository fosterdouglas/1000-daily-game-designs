A simple variation on the standard 20 Questions formula.

In this version, it’s the guesser’s goal to uncover (through yes and no questions!) a certain person, thought up by the other player.  The main  stipulation being that the mystery person must have some sort of common connection between the two players.  Either both people know this person, have met them, have talked about them, or some other non-obscure connection.

The guesser has 20 questions to uncover the identity of the person.  The question of "Is it ~this~ person?" can only be made once, so be sure you know for sure when you guess!

(Thanks Madeleine!)
