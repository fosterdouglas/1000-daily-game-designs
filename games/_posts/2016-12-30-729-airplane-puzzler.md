In this game, you manage larger and larger planes of needy passengers and quick-moving staff.

You are in charge of all aspects of the plane as it’s flying.  When a passenger needs to use the bathroom, you need to decide when and which one they use.  But, they can’t go if the seat-belt sign is on, or if the food trolley is in the aisle, or if there’s too long of a line already.  The staff needs to be managed as well, taking care of food and drink duties, tending to patrons, and maintaining the plane.  Finally, the captain and co-captain need to be controlled, flying the plane correctly and safely.

It’s kind of like *The Sims* meets *Diner Dash*.
