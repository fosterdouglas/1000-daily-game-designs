In this sequel to the [smash hit](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/featured/013-going-up/) *Going Up*, manage and control the flow of the pedestrians on a morning commuter train.

Assume the role of a train conductor working for the BERT (Best Experience Rail Transit) corporation.  As your train stops at each station in the morning, rearrange, manage, and maintain your passengers and their satisfaction.  Ensure everybody can get out of the train at the correct stop by strategically positioning people based on their destination, spatial requirements, and attitude.

Continue challenging yourself to achieve Master Train Conductor as levels use longer trains, more difficult riders, obstacles inside the train car, and more.
