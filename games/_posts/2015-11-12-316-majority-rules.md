This interactive quiz game helps you and your friends take a large collection of activities and reduce it down to the most unanimously interesting choices.

The game would use interesting questions, scenarios, and budgets to quickly help a group of people decide what to do in a city on a given day.  Data from social media and event/ticketing apps could also be incorporated, but wouldnâ€™t be a primary focus.

The end goal of this game is to have fun, and quickly decide on a plan for the day or moment without wasting too much precious time.
