A game that can only be played with the people sitting around you at your local DMV.

This game works only on a local network or group that must be within 100 feet of a DMV.  As players join, they encounter DMV monsters that they must work together to destroy. The game would be themed around the DMV, obviously, and the bosses would be variations from cranky employees, anthropomorphized cars, and common emotions encountered at the DMV.  When a playerâ€™s number is called in real life and they stop playing, their abilities and progress may be  automatically passed onto the next player that joins.
