A mobile game where three people use only a compass to find each other.

This would require some testing, but what I image might happen is an interesting exploration in Game Theory. Each player can do one of three options:

1) Sit still
2) Head toward player 1
3) Head toward player 2

Depending on how many of the three players pick which of these options will lead to an interesting result.
