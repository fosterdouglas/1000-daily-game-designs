A puzzle game about the going-ons of your local neighborhood.

Via a cross-section view of the houses, solve puzzles local to each house as well as neighbourhood-wide puzzles.  Basic puzzles might include getting the kids to bed on time while making sure they all brush their teeth first, or preparing a hot dinner.  Complex puzzles might be like… retrieving a missing dog from a neighbor’s house without waking them up, or orchestrating a neighbourhood wide holiday celebration.

Each character you use to solve a puzzle grows slightly in a few key developmental areas, like Social, Intuition, and Wit.  Advancing in these areas helps them be more adept at solving puzzles later by increasing their persuasion with others, or their reaction and quietness.
