After talking last month about [Imbalanced Information](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/528-imbalanced-information-vol-1/){:target="_blank"}, I started thinking about a modified version of Tetris that would put it closer on the scale toward a Balanced type game.

In this modification on Tetris, the player can see along the side of the area the next upcoming 12 tetris pieces.  Or maybe even more than that if it’s designed in a certain way.  Maybe it’s the next 100 pieces. And the player can place "outlines" or shadows of the pieces as quickly as they want to, and they will continue to fall at their normal pace.  It would transform it into more of a strategy game, and less of an arcade game.
