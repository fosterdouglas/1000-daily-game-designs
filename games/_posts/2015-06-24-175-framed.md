A first person narrative game about photographic memory, a sleepy town in Montana, and 4 missing teenagers.

The protagonist has an unusual cerebral gift; when she holds her hands up to create a frame with her thumbs and forefingers, she will forever remember precisely what was within the frame.  When four of her peers are targeting and go missing, the sheriff of her quiet Montana town enlists her help with the investigation. But as she uncovers pieces of truth, the evidence shows an unexpected side of the story that points back toward her own motives and role in the investigation.
