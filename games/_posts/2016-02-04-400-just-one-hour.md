A game played over the course of exactly one hour.

This digital game is designed to be played for exactly one hour at a time.  It’s paced specifically for this time frame, can’t be stopped early (without suffering some sort of sacrifice), and can’t be played for longer unless a second session is started.

It’s not meant to be a mechanism to prevent people from playing games for too long (although it may have that side effect), but more of a commentary on and design around the idea of a controlled and directed experience.
