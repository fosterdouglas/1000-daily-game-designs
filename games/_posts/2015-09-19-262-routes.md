A brain-training game that helps with sequential memorization.

On a top-down map, ride buses through the city, transferring when necessary, with increasingly complex destinations.  You’re new to this city, so make sure you keep track of which routes you’ve taken, and where they go!  At the end of the day, recall your trip by tracing the paths you took and the transfers made.

(This could also be applied in an interesting way to real life… a game that teaches you to better learn the bus or transit system of a city, decreasing our reliance on phones to direct us.)
