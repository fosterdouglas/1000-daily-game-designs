A top-down coffee brewing simulator.

With a cutout aesthetic, this coffee game has you grinding, brewing, and serving coffee to customers at your local coffee bar. Manage your brewing speed and quality with your conversations, eye contact, and customer service abilities.

I love the idea of simulating that multi-disciplinary aspect of the cafe service industry, creating relationships and maintaining them while providing a quality product.

Maybe kind of like a static *Stardew Valley* meets *Papers, Please* and a dash of *Cooking Mama*?
