There's very little doubt in my mind that augmented reality will have a significant impact on the game's industry, and specifically on game design.  It's basically like adding an entirely new tool for game designers to use to craft amazing and immersive experiences.

This game simulates hunting, without actually killing anything.

It, to me, seems like the ideal use of something like AR.  It's like *Pokemon Go* except instead of throwing Poke Balls, you're throwing sharp pointy objects.  And instead of Pokemon, it's bears. Or elephants, for the black market hunters out there.

The game could feature a rich economy where materials from the killed animals can be sold to other hunters, and the player can use these materials to craft different weaponry of different qualities.

This would be a great way for people to get their hunting "fix" without actually killing animals just for sport.
