title: 662 Highway Drop
categories: mobile-game
---
A casual mobile game where you drop things from a highway overpass to try and hit cars at different speeds and sizes.

It might be kind of like *Frogger* or a similar classic top-down game.  You’re perched on top of a highway overpass, looking down at the cars zooming by beneath you.  Different weighted and sized and functioning items are fed to you randomly (maybe like the pieces in Tetris), and you have to work quickly to drop them on the passing vehicles.

Items to drop could include: fruits and vegetables, water balloons, pillows, feathers, and so on.  Hopefully all things that wouldn’t actually destroy the cars when they hit them.
