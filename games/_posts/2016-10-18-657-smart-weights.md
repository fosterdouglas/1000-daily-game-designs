Dumbell/free weights should be smarter.  It wouldnâ€™t be hard for a system to be incorporated that tracks your sets and reps, gives you a weekly routine/schedule, helps you choose the right weight to be using, etc. 

The weights could track your movement while using them to know when you are fatiguing, and how much to push your muscles, based on your diet or rest schedule that week.  It would also connect to an iPad/iPhone app to show you your progress graphed out, as well as to help you set goals and let you know about milestones and achievements.
