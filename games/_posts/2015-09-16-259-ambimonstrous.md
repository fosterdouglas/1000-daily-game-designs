A touch-controlled game that helps diversify your handed-ness.

Eye-hand coordination is a way more beneficial skill when it’s not just your dominant hand. Although the majority of us have a strong allegiance with one hand or the other, there’s no reason to neglect our relationship with the weaker one.

This touch game would encourage players to play with their non-dominant hand.  The game would incorporate exercises that use both hands, so it wouldn’t feel frustrating the whole time.  It may also incorporate modes that pair with other devices, like the Apple Pencil, to train advanced ambidextrous skills.

*Why should we have one dominant hand when there's two to work with?*
