An experimental web game that uses the “Special:Random” function of Wikipedia to populate its content.

Each level of this stylized dungeon crawler is dynamically populated using the words and associated ideas of a random wikipedia page.  The length of the level is dependent on the size of the wikipedia article.  The algorithm uses key words to create environments for each level of the dungeon (much like the Scribblenauts games have objects that represent many nouns and verbs).

The gameplay would potentially be similar to the PSP cult classic *Half-Minute Hero*.

If players liked a specific floor, they could go to a separate part of the game to replay or share a single level, based on the wikipedia page URL.  They could also craft their own dungeons of multiple wikipedia URLs strung together.
