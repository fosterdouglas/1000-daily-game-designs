title: 654 Game Rules For Old People
tags: game-opinion
---
Last week I saw a group of elderly (elderly? is that appropriate? they were only in their 70â€™s probably) people playing bridge together at a coffee shop.  Actually, it was like 4 groups of them.  It was quite the sight; 2 parts cute, 2 parts intense, 1 part funny.

I overheard one of them explaining the rules of the game they were playing to the others. It sounded arduous, both for the explainer and the audience.  There has to be a better way for us to express game rules to one another quickly and easily.
