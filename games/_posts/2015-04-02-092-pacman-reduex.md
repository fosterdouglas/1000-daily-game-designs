A slight twist on PacMan, where the goal is to pick up as few dots as possible instead, while still eating all six of the ghosts.

Strategy for this game would be focused on visualizing out a path that the player can utilize for the duration of the level that will keep them safe from ghosts, but also allow them to chase and trap them successfully.
