A basic match three puzzle game, expanded onto a 3D grid, and played with a VR headset and motion gloves.

The player controls a faint ball of light, using a motion control glove peripheral. The puzzle is floating out in front of the player, and as the hand is reached forward, the light sphere snaps to the puzzle pieces. Closing your hand grabs the piece and moving your hand then moves the pieces. Release your grip to swap pieces.
