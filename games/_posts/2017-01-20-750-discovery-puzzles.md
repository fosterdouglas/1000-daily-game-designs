A type of Jigsaw Puzzle that don’t tell you what they are before you put them together.

I think it’s interesting that puzzles are focused on recreating an image, but it might be interesting if it could be focused on the discovery and creation of an image simultaneously.

The actual content of the image would have to be chosen carefully, as some things would be incredibly frustrating or difficult to create just from looking at the pieces of it.
