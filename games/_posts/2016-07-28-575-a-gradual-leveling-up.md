title: 575 A Gradual Leveling Up

Yesterday, I was talking about a [Gradual Skill Tree](){:target="_blank"} system, but maybe this can be applied to the classic "leveling up" system thatâ€™s found in so many games now.

Instead of focusing on a bar that represents how much time or effort until your next level up, this system just rewards you directly. Essentially, the game would be taking the amount of reward it gives you at the end of filling that bar, and instead stretch it out across each would-be increment of it.

Having set goals is good though, so removing this may need to be carefully balanced with some other system that was goal focused.  Depending on the style of game, that could be in the form of a skill tree, a "job" system, or some sort of environmental or level progression.
