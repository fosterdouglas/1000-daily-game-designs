title: 899 Realizing That Voltage Is Just A Variation Of Hex
tags: game-design-topic

It’s hard to come up with fresh and unique ideas.  Particularly if you are trying to do it on a daily basis.  But really, in general it’s just difficult.

One of my past game ideas, while in school at Savannah College of Art and Design, was a game called *Voltage*.  I love the design, but recently realized (from my game theory class) that it’s not really much more than a slight variation on a well-established game system called Hex.

It can be difficult to come to terms with this, and it’s happened a few times to me.  It’s basically the process of coming up with an idea, realizing it’s an idea that is worthy of exploring, either exploring it or not, and then eventually realizing that it was already someone else’s idea.

This doesn’t necessarily invalidate my idea as being good, especially if it were created separate from knowing the original idea, but the feeling of disappointment is difficult to resist.
