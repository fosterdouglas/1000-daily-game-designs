A game that takes place entirely in the backseat of a car.

This would probably work best as a VR game, although Iâ€™m not sure about motion sickness, as the player would constantly be moving in the game.  It may require a piece of hardware, maybe a "chair" that moves to better simulate being in a car.

The gameplay would be minimal, but not non-existant.  The focus of the game would be mostly experiential and narrative.
