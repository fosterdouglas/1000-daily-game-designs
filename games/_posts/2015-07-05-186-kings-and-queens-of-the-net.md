A couch cooperative game with one player at the controller and another at a laptop, computer, or cell phone using the internet as support.

The game is a two-player experience, with the 2nd player being in charge of researching and relaying facts from the internet quickly while the 1st person manages the incoming requests and data.  This could manifest as an RPG, a puzzle game, or a strategy game.  The idea is an asynchronous cooperative experience that requires different skill-sets to work together to accomplish a goal.
