title: 370 Made Up Words
tags: experimental-game
---
A social game about identifying and inventing made up words.

Two modes in this game, **invent** and **identify**. During invent, its the players job to come up with strange and interesting words that don’t yet exist.  In identify, the community decides what the word can potentially mean.  There’s also a viewing mode that allows the community to see which ridiculous definitions people have voted most for with each word.
