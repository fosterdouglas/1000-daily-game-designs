American football, but played with fresh fruits and vegetables.

Tougher vegetables are preferred, since they hold their shape better.  The game is played with a total of 20 fruits/vegetables, swapping in a new one when the previous type has been too destroyed to use for play.

Itâ€™s the job of the players to play normal american football as usual, as well as to try and not destroy the ball.

The game is over when all the balls have been used.
