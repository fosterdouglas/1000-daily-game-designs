A game about the fictional character of Quilt Man.

Quilt Man solves crimes, mostly related to fabrics and thread.  His weakness is that he’s almost always wrapped in a quilt blanket, making it difficult for him to defend himself.  Luckily, many of the crimes he solves don’t require him to defend himself.

He’s "strong, but soft."

He looks something like this:
