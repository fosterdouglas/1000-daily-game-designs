A story about the first nuclear fusion device tested, it’s implications on the world post-WWII, and the effects it had on the people involved in developing it.  You play as a scientist, and must help to develop technology that’s only eventual use is to potentially kill millions of people.

(Maybe it has the same weight and tone as *Valiant Hearts*.)
