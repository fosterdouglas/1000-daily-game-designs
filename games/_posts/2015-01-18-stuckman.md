The classic game of hangman with a slight twist; instead of constructing the traditional hangman graphic each time a guess is incorrect, the guesser adds that incorrectly guessed letter to a single space in the word.

So, if the board looked like:

_ _ a _
W a _ _

and the letter G was incorrectly guessed, then the guesser must choose an open space to place a g in, such as:

_ _ a g
W a _ _

and continue on guessing, with the knowledge that this spaceâ€™s true letter will always be unknown.
