A game to help you track your contribution to a home composting bin.

This game motivates you to be aware of your interactions with composting.  It helps you track your compost easily and quickly, and rewards you each week for feeding your wormies.  Compete against your friends for bragging rights with the best compost bin in the neighborhood.

Potentially, simple hardware could be developed and placed inside the compost to measure things like moisture, temperature, and pH level, potentially useful information for the worm master.
