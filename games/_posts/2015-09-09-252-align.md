This puzzle brain training game tests your timing, reflexes, and pattern recognition.

The game uses circles orbiting other shapes.  You must tap or determine when they will all overlap to succeed.  Other variations could include some sort of color matching, or color mixing style game.  The primary focus though, would be on pattern recognition and being able to execute on it.  The example below would be an extremely simple or early puzzle.
