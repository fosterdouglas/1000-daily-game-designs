Like the classic board game Life, but played in reverse.

Start by picking your character from a large selection of portrait cards.  The game begins and you’re already dead.  It’s your job to live your character’s life backwards, piece together their story, and ultimately reconstruct a happy life for them.

At least you can’t die in this game, since you started out dead anyway.
