How can we use gamification to help drive changes in people’s ecological habits?

I wonder if there’s a way that we could make people feel more accountable for the things they do that affect the environment.  We live in an age of big data, so I imagine that making a system to track various usage stats and use them to inform and motivate people would be possible.

We could add basic trackers to our water usage, trash, and electricity with no problems at all.  Take this data and siphon it into a platform that encourages people to meet goals, stay under thresholds, and change habits to accommodate new “eco” conscious methods.
