A story about a group of fish who think that the people outside of their Aquarium are the ones trapped.

This backward narrative would feature simple fish swimming gameplay and activities, with a heavy focus on storytelling.  The character development would play a main role.  Like the fish tank in *Finding Nemo* plus the illusory and quirkiness vibes of *Madagascar*.  These fish and aquatic creatures would spend the majority of their day talking about the how weird the trapped humans are just beyond the glass.
