A VR game to help increase your depth perception skill.

While this could be applicable to so many different areas of one’s life, the immediate idea came from being able to perceive depth while driving a car.  That is, to be able to accurately tell how large your car is while you’re inside of it.

The game would use various forms of learning to help test your current abilities with depth perception, and slowly begin pushing and exercising it.  Benchmark tests would be used occasionally to measure growth and encourage continued practice.
