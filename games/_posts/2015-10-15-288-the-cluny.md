Take on the role of a bar owner and tender when your father falls ill and passes it down into your control.

A dynamic narrative game; never leave your bar, let the action come to you!  Your bar ebbs and flows with life.  Make decisions to improve it, interact or ignore customers, change prices, hire and fire employees, and manage your finances.  Each of these decisions affect the bar, the patrons that come in, and ultimately the storyline that’s told.

If you make X decision, your bar becomes a place where more of a certain type of person might hang out, versus Y decision.  The people who come to your bar dictate the stories you experience.
