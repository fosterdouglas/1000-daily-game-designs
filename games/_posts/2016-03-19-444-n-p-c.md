Now-Playable Characters.

In this mechanic, players assume the role of the illusive game NPC (non-player character).

In one implementation, take a game like *Dark Souls*, but give control of all enemies to individual players.  Players in this online game are assigned randomly to a class of monster, and are given an area of the level to patrol.  The levels would have to be much shorter, to avoid too much unnecessary downtime.  If a player manages to be successful at killing the hero running through the level, they are promoted (kind of like *Shadow of Mordor*?). As they are promoted, they can eventually become the final boss of the level.
