A story about the earth/moon gravity deterioration, and if that changed, what would it look like. ([Orbital Decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay/){:target="_blank"})

The story begins with an object hitting the far side of the moon, pushing it dangerously closer to the Earthâ€™s surface, but not immediately colliding with Earth.
