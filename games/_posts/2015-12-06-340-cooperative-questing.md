title: 340 Cooperative Questing

Even in games that are specifically designed for co-op play, it feels like sometimes they arenâ€™t.

This is an idea for cooperative questing.  Both (or all) players in this system are able to start, progress, and complete a given quest, as well as work on multiple concurrently.  Some of the quests would be specifically designed to require or encourage the players to split up to complete the task, require it, or encourage/require not splitting up.

The game would need to display information to each player in a smart way, potentially using color coding, controller vibration, and a smart UI to organize the information. Playing the recently release *Fat Princess Adventures* game sparked these ideas, as it attempts to do something similar but falls short.
