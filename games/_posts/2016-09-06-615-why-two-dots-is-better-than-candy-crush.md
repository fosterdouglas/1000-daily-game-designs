title: 615 Why Two Dots Is Better Than (And The Same As) Candy Crush
tags: game-opinion

I’ve been playing *Two Dots* a lot recently (Thanks Madeleine…….).

At its very core, it’s a match-3 game.  It takes concepts from many different games and collects them together into a sleek and fun package, and it alters some things (can’t match diagonally!) to keep it interesting and unique.

But really, it’s barely different than *Candy Crush*, right?  It’s a matching game where you progress level-by-level upward through a nearly endless map of challenges.  Every 10 or 20 levels, a new concept is introduced that makes the levels more difficult.

It feels like there is a bit more care put into the levels of *Two Dots* than *Candy Crush* though, and there is certainly a much more minimized feeling of the sleazy pay-to-win aspects.  It also has a more modern and sleek design, which is appealing to me but maybe other people don’t notice or care much about.
