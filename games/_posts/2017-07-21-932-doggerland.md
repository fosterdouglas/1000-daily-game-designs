([Doggerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland){:target="_blank"}) is the area that, 10,000 years ago, used to connect Britainâ€™s landmass to mainland Europe.

I think this could make a great location for an exploration or action-adventure game setting, maybe similar to something like *Horizon: Zero Dawn*.
