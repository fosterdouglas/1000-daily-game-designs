A mobile game about balancing on a bike that’s clearly too small for your fat ass.

With your mobile device’s tilt sensor, balance yourself on the bike, riding for as long as possible.  Use first person mode for an extra challenge.  Look out for obstacles like pot-holes, paper cups, pebbles, and leaves; even the smallest debris could unbalance you!
