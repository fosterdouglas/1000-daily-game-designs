title: 829 "Fun To Play" Versus "Fun To Watch" Versus "Fun To Play Being Watched"

Not all games are both fun play and fun to watch someone else play, of course.  But, there’s a third category: fun to play while being watched.  This basically defines what twitch and game streaming is.

What defines this third category?  It’s hard to say.  But it’s certainly independent and not reliant on "fun-to-play" and almost entirely dependent on "fun-to-watch."  But often it may be neither, and is only fun because it’s being watched by a certain audience and being played by a certain streamer.

As I’m writing this, I’m realizing… who cares?  As long as it’s fun in some way, that’s what we care about. /end
