WTP, or **"What’s The Point?"** syndrome is an affliction on many games that are released on mobile devices, like Android and iOS.

These games can sometimes be identified by the following traits:

- Timers. Any time a game is asking you to wait 2hour and 37min before you can do anything again, it’s been a victim of WTP.
- Currencies. Don’t be fooled by "wood" or "stars" or "energy" that you need to play the game.  If there’s more than one currency, usually WTP?
- Collecting. Anything in a game that is waiting for you tap on it to be collected is probably a direct result of WTP.  Don’t let your serotonin rule you, tap-to-collect is deceiving you.
- Rushing. Related to timers, anything that can be activated to "save time" is in direct correlation to the WTP principal.
- Tap. If "tap" is in the game’s title, the game is probably mostly tapping. Probably too much tapping. WTP.
- Real money.  If you have to pay more than once for a game, really WTP? I don’t buy Scrabble and then have to go back to the store when I realize that they’ve only given me half of the letters I need to play. WTP WTP WTP.
- Investment.  A game should always respect your time and investment in it.  If you are wasting time in a game because it’s forcing you to do collect or do certain tasks, WTP?
