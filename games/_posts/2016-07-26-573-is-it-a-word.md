A simple web game… Is it a word?

Respond yes or no to words that are either Many of these would be words that look like real words or are often used as real words but aren’t actually, like many words that start with **un-**, or some commonly used words like **irregardless**, **sherbert**, or **unthaw**.

After each word that you answer for, whether correctly or not, if it’s **not** a word, it explains to the player why it isn’t or how it is typically incorrectly used and what can be used in its place.
