A game and peripheral that simplifies muscle growth or weight loss tracking.

The connected peripheral would be a flexible ribbon or band material, wrapped around the userâ€™s target areas (arms, stomach, thighs, chest, etc). The app would then use tracking to motivate and/or gamify the progress of your workout routines.
