A suite of games that doesn't use a controller.

Mental interaction is such an incredibly interesting phenomenon. If you see a math problem on a screen, you don’t actually need to do anything physical with it to interact with it (Ok. Yes. I know technically what’s going on in your brain is a physiological process.. I mean external functions!).  All you do is **think** to interact.  This suite of mind games embraces that concept.

The game would only require you to interact with it to launch it.  After this, the entire thing runs itself. 

Alternatively, this may be too extreme.  The game may require you to interact with it to answer questions periodically, basically to externalize the information you’ve built up mentally while playing.
