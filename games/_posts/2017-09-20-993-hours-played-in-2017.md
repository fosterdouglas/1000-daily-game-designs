### 356 hours

In 2017, I spent a lot of the year traveling. About half of the year I was out of the country, and the majority of the year I didn’t have an apartment of my own. This definitely affected how many hours I had available for gaming, and this has ultimately been the least hours I’ve played in a given year since before I started tracking, in 2012.

Overall though, it was a worthy sacrifice, as there were many great experiences to be had around the world, which have informed many of the things I wrote about this year.
