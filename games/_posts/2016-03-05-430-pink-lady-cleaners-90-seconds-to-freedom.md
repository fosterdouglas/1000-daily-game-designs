title: "430 Pink Lady Cleaners: 90 Seconds To Freedom"
tags: simulation-game, touch-controlled-game
---
This is a game about cleaning, inspired by the insanely fast bullet-train cleaning ladies of Japan.

Each level would feature more and more ridiculous locations and situations that your team of Pink Ladies must tackle.  Drag each of your PL’s to a specific task to direct them to do it. Manage their time as efficiently as possible, while ensuring that you don’t burn out their energy too quickly.  Finish the job in 90 seconds, or face the shame and embarrassment of not living up to the Pink Lady Legacy.

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Deck 3 - Tempest Rising*** and ***Fat Princess Adventures*** ]
