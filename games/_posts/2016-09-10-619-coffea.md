A coffee growing and roasting simulator.

The coffee industry is an incredibly complex and nuanced beast. Which, I think, suits it perfectly for a simulation style game.  I've done quite a few of these simulation posts, but I think this one might be most appropriate to the genre.

This would be a multi-leveled simulation game.  One half of it is focused on the growing, cultivation, drying, and processing of the coffee fruit, and the other half is focused on the roasting, grinding, and selling.

This could also potentially be used for basic training for new baristas.
