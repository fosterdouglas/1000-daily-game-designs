---
A card game designed for the blind.

Cards in this custom desk are numerous shapes and sizes, and contain varying types of cutouts, notches, and textures.

Players must collect, trade, and barter their way to victory.  By describing (or lying about) the cards in hand, players attempt to verbally convince others to trade with them.

Only the player whose turn it is, is allowed to lie. All other players must answer and trade truthfully based on what is asked of them. Collect 3 sets of identical cards to win!

Alternatively, this could be played by the sighted, using blindfolds.
