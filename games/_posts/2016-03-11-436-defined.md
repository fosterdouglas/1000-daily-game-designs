An open-source dictionary collaboration game.

The oxford dictionary has been around for a long time; that doesn’t mean it’s always right.

In this "game," compete and collaborate with players around the world to define, redefine, and argue over the best definitions for words.  Vote on and discuss the best definitions, for both new and classic words, common and obscure.
