A game filled entirely with babies. Like *World of Warcraft* but with babies.

In this sim world gone awry, all of the planet’s adults have gone mysteriously missing.  Control your baby avatar and navigate the perils of growing up in an adult-free environment.  Maybe, it’s like *Rugrats* meets *Peanuts* plus *The Sims*.

Babies would interact with one another using limited language abilities, trader/barter with commodities (blocks, binkies, milk) instead of money, and form groups based on similar goals and interests.

(Thanks Madeleine!)
