[Last year](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/367-retrospective-the-list/){:target="_blank"} I did this thing where I made a retrospective list of some of my favorite or most meaningful posts of the year.  I think I’ll do it again this year! Here we go:

<h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;"><a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/382-third-person-blurring/" target="_blank">382 Third Person Blurring</a></h2>
I loved this idea, and I still do.  I think it’s an interesting solution to an immersion problem in gaming.

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/388-nomnomgalaxy-makes-soup-into-business/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">388 NomNomGalaxy Makes Soup Into Business</h2></a>
The first time (and last? though not purposefully) that I had someone else write for this blog.  It was great to get additional perspective on a shared experience, especially from someone that I respect highly the opinions of.

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/399-emojirace/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">399 emojiRace</h2></a>
I wrote a group of "emoji" based game ideas, and for some reason this one is my favorite.  Kevin and I are hoping to actually develop this one in the near future.

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/436-defined/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">436 Defined</h2></a>
An interesting word game that I would love to explore.  It’d be like a respectable version of UrbanDictionary.

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/467-julia/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">467 Julia</h2></a>
I’ve gotten more and more interested in cooking over the past year, and this seems like an interesting product of that new passion.  I also love that it’s called Julia.  Seems to be a nice addition to "Siri" and "Alexa."

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/500-the-big-five-oh-oh/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">500 The Big Five Oh Oh</h2></a>
I had a nice celebration for my 500th post, and the documentation of it is… mildly interesting!

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/528-imbalanced-information-vol-1/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">528 Imbalanced Information, Vol. 1</h2></a>
As a part of my ongoing series of posts that are somewhat academic, this post goes pretty deep into balanced/imbalanced information in gaming.

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/540-imbalanced-information-vol-2/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">540 Imbalanced Information, Vol. 2</h2></a>
A continuation of the thoughts from the first volume.

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/548-the-simplicity-complexity-scale-vol-1/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">548 The Simplicity Complexity Scale, Vol. 1</h2></a>
Again, a part of the ongoing academic posts.

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/569-wtp/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">569 What’s The Point?</h2></a>
A semi-funny piece about the tropes of iOS App Store games. WTP!

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/577-the-simplicity-complexity-scale-vol-2/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">577 The Simplicity Complexity Scale, Vol. 2</h2></a>
And, part duex!

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/596-rechess/)" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">596 [ReChess</h2></a>
I’ve written many chess alternates, but this one is by far my favorite.

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/684-the-importance-of-contextual-design/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">684 The Importance Of Contextual Design</h2></a>
One more in the academic series!

<a href="http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/715-poorly-written-passwords/" target="_blank"><h2 style="color:#9B9B9B;">715 Poorly Written Passwords</h2></a>
One of my all-time favorite posts.  I hope to make this one a reality in the future.
