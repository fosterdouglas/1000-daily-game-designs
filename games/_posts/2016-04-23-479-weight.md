A game that uses some really weird dice.

This dice game uses dozens of (literally) loaded dice to manipulate, confuse, and otherwise cause players to second-guess and deliberate their choices.

There are 5 standard dice types included, the standard D6, and then a D8, D10, D12, and D20.  There are 10 of each die, and 4 different colors. 3 black, 3 grey, 3 white, and 1 red.  They colors correspond to:

- Black… these dice are weighted toward lower numbers.  For example, on a D12, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 would be most commonly rolled.
- Grey… these dice are weighted toward middle numbers.  On a D12, this die typically rolls numbers 5, 6, and 7.
- White… these dice are weighted toward the highest numbers.  On a D12, numbers 10, 11, and 12 come up most often.
- Red… these are special dice.  They contain only the two extremities of a range.  On a D12, 6 sides would be the number 1, and 6 sides the number 12.

The player would be making dice roll decisions based on colors of the dice, challenging other players, trading dice, and so on.  It would be designed to push the player’s faith in percentages.
