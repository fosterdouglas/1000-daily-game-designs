A second-person choose-your-own-adventure RPG.

The story takes place through a narrator telling somebody else, or a group of people, the story. As the narrator speaks, his actions come to life in the RPG that the player is controlling.  For example, “And the wind bellowed loud and blustery…” would trigger a big gust of wind in the game.  But the game would include interaction between the player and the storyteller.  If the storyteller said something the player was to do “And then You walked over to Your friend’s house to say goodbye” but the player did something different, the narrator would correct himself through dialogue, and come to a compromise: “Or, maybe You forgot to go over to Your friend’s house; that’s ok, she’ll forgive You for forgetting to say goodbye forever to her.”  

Similar in style to *Bastion*'s third-person narrative style, but more interactive play between the player’s character and the narrator.
