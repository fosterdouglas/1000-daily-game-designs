Twitch to me has always been a platform to consume in solitude.  There are people, I’m sure, who watch it with their significant other or with a group of friends occasionally.  But in general, it’s a thing to do alone. 

Because you’re not alone, you’re watching with a community of dozens (up to sometimes multiple thousands) of other people.  It’s solitary, but it’s not.

I spent some time with Kevin recently, watching Twitch together.  I think there’s something uniquely interesting about it.  There’s already a interesting dialogue going on between the streamer and the viewer and the other viewers, but it’s really enhanced in a nice way when that dialogue can be even more complex, involving another person sitting next to you on the couch.
