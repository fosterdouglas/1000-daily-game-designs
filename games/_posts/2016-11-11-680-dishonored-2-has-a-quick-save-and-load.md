I love this.  And I love this game.

Basically you pause, hold R2 for a moment, and it quick saves the game for you and closes the pause screen.  A 4 or 5 second process.

Yes, I realize this has been a thing that PC players have been doing for literally multiple decades.

I’m just extremely thankful that it’s finally showing up in console games.  Thank you *Dishonored*.
