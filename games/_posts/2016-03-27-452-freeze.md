Spend less money by challenging yourself to a FreeZe.

Similar to [We Save](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/103-we-save/){:target="_blank"}, although focused on the specific practice of not spending money at all.  Set a goal (1 day, 3 days, or even 1 week!), and see if you can go that long without spending any money.  Or, play more relaxed, and simply keep track of and focus on how long you go without spending money.  Play with strict rules that consider any money spending equally, or flex rules that let things like rent, loan payments, or bills to not break your streak.
