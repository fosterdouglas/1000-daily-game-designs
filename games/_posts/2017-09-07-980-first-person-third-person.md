In this bizarre game mechanic, the player can see both first-person and third-person views at the same time.

I’m not exactly positive how this would best be implemented, but what I’m not picturing is just a split screen of 1st person on one side and 3rd person on the other (although, that maybe be interesting and strange too, but potentially not sustainable).

Maybe the player is seeing through the eyes of 1st person as normal, but what they’re looking at in front of them is also themself in 3rd person, from behind. Like following yourself.
