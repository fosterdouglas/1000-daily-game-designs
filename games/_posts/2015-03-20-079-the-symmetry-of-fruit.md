title: 079 The Symmetry Of Fruit
categories: childrens-game, educational-game, touch-controlled-game
---
A game designed to teach children basic principles of symmetry in math and in nature, by using fruit as a theme.

Kids would learn about math while having fun chopping fruit into different shapes and sizes.  They would also learn secondary things, about different fruits (both common and exotic) and their tastes, colors, regions, and how to eat them and cut them properly.
