A game about getting faster and faster at your routine morning travel route to work.

Use your OCD-fueled skills to come up with progressive enhancements to your daily commute, getting there more quickly each day.  Study train schedules, traffic patterns, street lights and stop signs, cross walks, motivational music, coffee, distractions, and more.  Find the ideal route for each challenge stage, in turn helping you to think about your own commute to work in the morning and how it can be revised.
