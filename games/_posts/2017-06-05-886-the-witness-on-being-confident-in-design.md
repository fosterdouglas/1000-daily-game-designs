title: 886 The Witness, On Being Confident In Design
tags: experimental-game

One major aspect of Jonathan Blow’s *The Witness* that I have to praise is his trust in the player.

His designs trust that the player will have the patience and take the time to understand them.  And this trust is seated, I think somewhat, in a general amount of his own confidence in the puzzle designs and world he created.

If you take the time to make something thoughtful and challenging, and you’re confident in what it’s doing, then people will see the strength behind it and the care and craft that went into it.

I think players are patient if you give them a reason to be and respect their time.
