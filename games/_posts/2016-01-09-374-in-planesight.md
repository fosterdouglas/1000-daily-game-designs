A airplane game of iSpy out the windows.

This wi-fi game is played on the plane.  Enable your device’s wi-fi once airborne (strictly following any FAA regulations, of course! blah blah blah).  The app will locate you, and begin asking you questions about what you see out the window, when a good time to look down is, and facts about what you’re flying above.

The game is best played during the day time, and with a window seat.  However, it would also include a mode that could be played at night and/or with an aisle seat.

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Hangman*** and ***Persona 4: Dancing All Night*** and ***Professor Layton and the Last Specter*** ]
