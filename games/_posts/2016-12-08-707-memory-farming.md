A narrative game about a corporation that sacrifices people to farm their memories.

Or, something about memory in general.

I’ve always been incredibly fascinated by the concept of memory.  How personal it is, how ephemeral, how enduring, how malleable, and how crucial.  It’s crazy that things that have happened so long ago to us personally can still be so important to who we are; or on the flip side, how we tend to completely forget about other things.
