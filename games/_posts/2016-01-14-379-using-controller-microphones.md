title: 379 Using Controller Microphones

An additional idea that came out of [yesterday’s post] is the idea of using our console’s controller microphones in some more creative ways.

In one example, based on playing *Fallout 4*, the microphone is constantly "listening" to the game’s audio output.  When the controller microphone hears a certain piece of NPC dialogue, the game knows that there’s a likely chance that the player also heard that line (since players are typically pretty close to the controller they’re holding).  The game can track this, and use it to its advantage to avoid reusing that dialogue again, enhancing the players unique experience.

Other uses could include simple by extremely functional voice commands.  Again, in the case of *Fallout 4*, the player could hold a button on the controller and say "Travel to Diamond City" and the game would initiate that action.  It may not seem like much, but depending on how savvy the player is with a controller and the map system, this could potentially save a minute of time each time its used.  Multiplied over 100’s of times (or more), it could certainly prove useful.  Of course, I don’t claim to anything about the way voice recognition works, and it would be its own challenge to make that work correctly to begin with.
