So many games we play (with controllers) require us to push forward on the analog sticks.  Forward with some occasional variation of whether it's left-forward or right-forward.  This is partly by design though, the camera is controlled with one stick, allowing for broad changes, while the other stick is use for precision adjustment.

In this game, you are holding back on the analog stick instead. The exact genre this game would be isn't clear.  If it were first person, it would be the character you are controlling running backward.  If it were side scrolling, it would be that your character was moving from right to left instead (not a massively ground breaking idea, but it would certainly feel strange).  It's an interesting prospect though, to use a controller in a different way than we typically do.
