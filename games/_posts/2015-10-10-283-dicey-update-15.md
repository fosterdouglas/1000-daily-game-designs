An updated on [Dicey](http://sandcastle.co/dicey){:target="_blank"}:

Recently, we decided to adjust to gameplay a bit.  Let’s say your doing a 5 second level with 7 dice.  Instead of the game ending after 5 seconds, the player instead has to bash the spacebar key before that 5 seconds is up.  The spacebar action indicates that you’re done counting the dice, but it also indicates that the player thinks its been less than 5 seconds.  If the spacebar is pressed too late, the player must try again.

We’ve also started adding placeholder animations to the dice rolling!
