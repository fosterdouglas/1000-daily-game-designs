title: 543 Uncharted's Smarter AI
categories: game-mechanic-system, game-opinion

As a continuation of my *Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End* gushing, I was recently surprised by the step up that the game has made in AI compared to previous entries.

Hiding from enemies after they "spot" you in these types of games has always been a weird thing in gaming.  Would they really lose sight of you so quickly, behind some rock somewhere?  And would they give up looking for you after 30 seconds of searching? Of course not.

*Uncharted* seems to have changed that a bit.  If a group of enemies does happen to lose sight of you, they will search and search relentlessly (and fairly smartly) to find you.  They won’t give up easily, and I think that’s a good thing.  The NPCs even interact with one another, discuss where they saw you and have checked for you, and fan out in a smart way to make it difficult for you to ignore or skip them entirely.
