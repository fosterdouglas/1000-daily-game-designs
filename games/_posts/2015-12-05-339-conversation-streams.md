title: 339 Conversation Streams

In this brain game, manage as many concurrent conversations as possible.

The goal here is to be able to retain information related to a conversation while new and unrelated information is introduced.  It’s mimicking the sensation of being in a small group of people and trying to participate in multiple streams of conversation at once.

It’s an aurally focused brain game, requiring the player to essentially listen to multiple streams of audio that are coming from different directions while retaining information from each one.
