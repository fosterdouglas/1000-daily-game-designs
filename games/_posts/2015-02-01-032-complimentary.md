Use color mixing and paint your way through this hex grid puzzle game, while learning complex color theory concepts. 

The player is given certain color choices at the beginning of the level, which they are allowed to paint with. Using a finger, they can paint onto the hexes with any of the available colors. The goal of the game is to make the hexes with inner stroke filled fully, by combining streams of other colors.
