Using [Dicey's](http://sandcastle.co/dicey){:target="_blank"} format and general skeleton, a yahtzee-style game with a twist.

6 dice are rolled into a circular area.  The circle’s perimeter stroke begins to fill green, counter-clockwise.  The player has 6 seconds to pull dice they want to keep out of the circle.  All dice remaining in the circle get re-rolled.  1 initial roll, and 2 re-rolls. The timer is based on the number of dice that are rolled. 6 seconds for 6 dice, 3 seconds for 3 dice, and so on.  Dice may not be put back into the circle after pulling them out.

Most yahtzee dice combinations apply. However, with an additional die, more options are available.  The single “pair” is no longer a viable combination (with 6 dice, it’s much too common), and the “full house” is no longer an option to avoid confusion with other combinations.  Some new combinations:

- Three pair (three different sets of two dice showing the same face)
- 5-of-a-kind (five dice showing the same face)
- 6-Speed (all six dice showing the same face)
- Ultimate Straight (showing one of each face, 1-6)
- Stairs (any three sequential faces, 3,4,5 etc)
- Two-Four (two of one face, and 4 of another)
- 21 and Done! (any 6 dice that add up to 21)

[Kevin](http://kevinmcgillivray.net){:target="_blank"} and I did some math wizardy to figure out some of the probabilities and combinations.  One fun fact, there are precisely 462 unique rolls that can be made with these 6 dice.  And 32 unique combinations to get the “21 and Done!” roll.  I’ve listed them below for funsies.
