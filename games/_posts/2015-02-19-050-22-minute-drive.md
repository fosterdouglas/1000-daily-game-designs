An immersive and scenic casual driving simulator / VR experience.

Sit back and relax as a passenger in this low-stress VR experience. You can look around from your seat, open and close your window, pick up your Coke bottle and drink from it, put on and take off your sun glasses, put your arm out the window, take pictures with your digital camera, or read a book. 

There are multiple routes to choose, from all around the world, and each is 22 minutes long.  You can also pick from road trips which range up to 6 hours long.
