Each time you hit a certain point in the game, the screen splits and half the screen begins replaying in real time the entirety of the game up until that point, while you continue controlling the other half of the screen.  You may temporarily jump back to controlling the original screen at any point, to affect the future (or present, really) of the live screen.  The game continues splitting screens up to a maximum of 2x2 grid of 4 different screens running at the same time.
