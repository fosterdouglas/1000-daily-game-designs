A method of designing levels that developers could use to enhance the realism of their work.

The reason that cities and forests and larger environments typically look great in video games is because we are familiar with them, and spend a lot of time in similar places in real life.  It’s easy for us to model things off of places we see all the time.  But what about sci-fi games, or more fictional stories or scenarios that take place in locations that aren’t so familiar?

What if level designers could create spaces and areas in software, and then walk around a projected version of that level.  Immediately, designing more realistic and “useable” spaces in games would occur.  The designers could use real feedback to inform how they redesign those spaces.
