Divide your grocery list up evenly and race to see who can get through theirs and reach the milk first.

This app is played with two people, either a couple, small family, or two roommates.  It’s integrated with grocery list apps that already exist; just simply export your week’s grocery list into Milk Race, divide up the items, and hit go!  Milk Race will track each person’s progress via GPS, so both players can see the others’ position, and progress to the Milk.

The loser has to pay for the Milk.
