title: 789 Guess The Rules

I wonder if you could create challenges, either physically or digitally, where the player had to guess the game’s rules based on the pieces presented to them.

For example, if someone had never played Catan, and all the pieces are laid out in front of them, could they surmise the general rules of the game?

That’s an intense example, probably not.  What about Scrabble, or Monopoly?  It’s maybe a lot like asking a player to play a digital strategy game for the first time without using the built-in tutorial.  Difficult.

This is basically just a thought experiment.
