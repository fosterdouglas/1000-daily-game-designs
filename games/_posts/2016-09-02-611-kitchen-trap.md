title: 611 Kitchen Trap!

This is a board game that’s played in the kitchen.  It’s kind of like MouseTrap.

This family board game is played in the kitchen.  It requires certain foods on hand to play, and involves interacting with foods, tasting and eating them, and progressing through the board game. It has a heavy focus on food sustainability, healthy eating, and the positives and negatives of groups of foods.
