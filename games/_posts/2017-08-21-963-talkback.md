A game about the lives of backpacks on people’s backs.

Maybe like Toy Story a little bit, backpacks can communicate with each other as they ride around on people’s backs. It’s a strange dynamic because they don’t get to see each other that often, as they’re each mostly facing the fronts of other people that are walking behind them.

The game could be about finding the opportunities to communicate with other backpacks, maybe during moments when people pass by each other, or while on train cars, or in grocery stores. Maybe you’re a backpack looking for others of your same type.
