In this brain game, use your brain's ability to compute unseen numbers as quickly as possible.

Variously sized stacks and cubes made up of dice are presented to the player, and they must count the sum of all the unseen sides of all the dice.  Later challenges could include various types of dice beyond 6-sixed ones, or include other challenging aspects to how the dice can be seen.

There could be a timed mode included, although that sounds too stressful.
