Kevin and I have, very reluctantly, been putting off this moment; we’re back at work on Underground.

What that means is… updates! We may eventually move Underground specific updates to a dedicated game dev blog (don’t worry, this one isn’t going anywhere), but for now they can live here.

We’ve moved into a phase where we will be creating many of what we’re calling Tech Tests.  This means we’ll be creating micro-slices of the game, in very rough forms visually, to test and iterate on the systems and design.

The first one we’re working on is the **style menu**.  It’s essentially the screen where the player can manage what their characters are wearing, and how that affects them.

It can be assumed that in these tech tests, **almost everything** is placeholder information.  Regardless, enjoy!
