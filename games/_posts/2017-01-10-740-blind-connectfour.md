A modification of ConnectFour.

In this version, the player’s turn is hidden from the opponent.  The player can’t watch their opponent actually place the piece in the game board.  At the beginning of the game, this won’t make too much of a difference because it be obvious to the players when it’s their turn which of the pieces has been added.  But as the board gets more complex, it requires more memory to keep track of each unseen move.
