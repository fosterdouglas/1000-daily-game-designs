A wise prophet once said that all things in this great world can be explained in 3 emoji or less.

Three is the magic number. In pictography, it allows us to communicate beyond the idea of just a single object or action, expanding our language to say things like include, exclude, over, under, inside, outside, within, without, and more.

In this game, you’re given a concept, phrase, or sentence and are tasked with figuring out how to represent it with only 3 emoji.

Alternatively, there could be a mode where it shows 3 emoji and you have to correctly guess the word/phrase.
