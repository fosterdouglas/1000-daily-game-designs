A train management simulation game, set on a global scale.

The HyperLoop is in our near future.  Why not beat it to the punch with a simulation game of it!

In this game, slowly and strategically build up the worldâ€™s first global hyperspeed train system.  Choose what cities your lines run through, what materials are used for construction, and how to budget your workers.  Manage the entire construction from beginning to end, and then continue to ensure that the lines run smoothly and efficiently.
