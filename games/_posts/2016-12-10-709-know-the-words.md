A game about knowing the dialogue in movies and being able to repeat along with it.

The game runs alongside a movie, and stays in sync with it by using a microphone to listen to the audio.

It listens to you (and the movie, to keep pace), and scores your ability to speak along with the film.  Gain extra points for lines that are difficult or fast, and for consecutive successful lines.
