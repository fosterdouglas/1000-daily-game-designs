title: 616 A Pay Gate For Your Phone

This is similar to that app you can use on your phone/computer to prevent you from going to certain websites for a set amount of time (students often use this to eliminate temptation to go to time-suck websites like Facebook during important study days?).

Instead, it’s a monetary pay gate to use your phone. Set a day, time range, or even one hour where you want to restrict your own access to your phone.  During this time there would be nothing you could do to release the restriction other than pay money.

There may be another variation where instead of paying money you had to play some sort of educational game?  Maybe language learning, or something related to a user’s interests or study.
