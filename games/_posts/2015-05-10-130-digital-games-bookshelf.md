A touch-LED display that’s dedicated to showing off your digital games collection.

This display is synchronized with all of your game accounts: PSN, XBL, WiiU, Steam, and so on.  Using a variety of viewing options, enjoy an interactive experience that shows off your extensive library of digital games.  Swipe through a classic side-of-the-box view, a basic list, a “cover flow” of game box art, and more.  Also show off your trophies, gamerscore, and achievements in an exciting and fun way.  Select any individual game to see a detailed description of that game, containing info such as: developer, publisher, year of release, platforms, other versions, series or sequels, available trophies/achievements, average length of play, trending popularity, and more.  Finally you can enjoy your library of digital games and show them off to your friends and family any time.
