Use basic shapes and colors to create harmony in this minimal puzzle game.

Using beautifully designed but simple shapes, arrange the given elements in the most harmonious and visually pleasing way possible.  There are no right or wrong compositions.  The game will provide you with basic responsive feedback as you go, and once your design is complete, it will give you suggestions and informative design sense blurbs about your decisions.

Itâ€™s not what you have, but how you use it that matters.
