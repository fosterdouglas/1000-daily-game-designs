A method for children learning broad categories, using "hats" as a metaphor for categories.

For example, if they were learning a new language, different "hats" would be used to teach them various parts of the language; wear the "grammar" hat one day, the "cultural" hat another day, or the "vocab" when learning new words.  This method could help children focus on specific things, while specifically reinforcing in their mind what it is they are learning that day or session. For older children, the actual act of wearing the hat isnâ€™t as important as the idea behind it, and could be integrated into the lesson or teaching in other ways, such as through a character that wears the hat.
