Most gamers have become fairly desensitized to guns and bullets in games. It’s not that we necessarily carry that feeling with us outside of these gaming worlds, but certainly within them we are accustomed to shooting, killing, looting, and reloading.

This game would be sharply designed around the very specific consequences of bullets: how they affect the environment, the body, how they react to different conditions, how to load them properly, how many it takes to actually kill somebody (like… 1?).

I’m not aware of any game that has fully simulated this, although I think the design of the game itself also should support the use of the system (as in, not just Gun Simulator 2017).
