Here’s a very incomplete list of my favorite games of all time, as of 2017. I had intended to write descriptions of each, but it turns out that would turn into a massive endeavor. I’ll be making a page in the future that I continually update that has something similar to this, but grows over time and changes. But, for now, in not any super particular order:

*Transistor*

*Borderlands 2*

*Valkyria Chronicles*

*Life is Strange*

*Dishonored* series

*Portal 2*

*XCOM: Enemy Within*

*Bioshock* series

*Journey*

*Ni No Kuni*

*Uncharted* series

*Person 4 Golden*

*Horizon: Zero Dawn*

*Darkest Dungeon*

*Towerfall Ascension: Dark Tower*

*Professor Layton* series

*Fire Emblem Awakening*

*Tropico 5*

*Diablo 3*

*The Witness*

*The Last of Us*

*Skyward Sword*

*Chrono Trigger*

*Earthbound*

*Bloodborne*
