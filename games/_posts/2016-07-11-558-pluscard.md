A card game using "plus" shaped playing cards.

The cards in this game basically have two cards "fused" together perpendicularly.  The cards can be used in either direction when played.  Games could also be designed to specially work with placing these plus shaped cards down on the table next to each other, and how a strategy can be build around that.

It might be numbers based, or the cards could have other objects or concepts on them that interact in certain ways depending on where they are placed.  A little bit like **Carcassonne** meets **Rivers Roads and Rails**, but not as square-ish.
