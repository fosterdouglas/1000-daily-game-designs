A pretty punny game.

This game has two modes:

Fill In That Blank - This mode is obvious.  A sentence is presented to the player with one missing word, and the player must fill in the correct word to complete the pun.  An example: "Iâ€™m not any '__(cheese)__' at this."  The obvious answer here is gouda.

Translate That Thing - This mode is also obvious.  Take a give sentence and replace any word or words with a different one to create a pun.  Example: A photo of a banana, and the words "I find this banana appealing."  The obvious answer here is that "appealing" = "a peeling."

(Thanks Madeleine!)
