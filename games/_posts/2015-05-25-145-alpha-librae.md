This RPG takes place primarily in a library.

Similar to the *Assassin’s Creed* series, the game’s narrative sections will be told from the perspective of a fully interactive library.  The player navigates the library in different ways to unveil pieces of the story.  As they visit different books and sections of the library, they are taken into the story from that book’s perspective, and play out that chapter of the game.

The game’s context is focused on the constellation Alpha Librae and it’s history and relation to the modern zodiac symbols.
