Continuing my slow and stead playthrough of *Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End*, it continues to shock and surprise me in a lot of wonderful ways.

Specifically there is a sequence, which was chosen early on before the game’s release as a section to show off the game (for good reason!), where Nathan and Sully are in a jeep driving down a mountain-side city, attempting to escape a large military vehicle.

While the premise (especially my bland description of it) doesn’t sound particularly unique, the execution absolutely is.  What makes it most exhilarating I think is that it gives the player complete freedom and choice on how to scale down the mountain, without having any notable consequences.  Basically, there’s no way to do it "wrong" but you still get to do it your way.  It’s really ideal, particularly in the narrative situation they’ve set up.

Technically speaking, it’s basically done through the construction of a loosely gridded city with dozens of side paths and options at every turn.  The game tells the player early on in the chase (through dialogue from one of the characters) that their goal is basically to just get down the mountain.  With this in mind, the player knows which general direction to head in, and can choose how to accomplish it their own way.

It results in absolutely joyous mayhem; pure excitement and exhilaration without sacrificing autonomy or realness.

Good on ya, *Uncharted*!
