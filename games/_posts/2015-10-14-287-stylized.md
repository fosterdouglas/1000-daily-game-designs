Each level in this experimental platformer is set inside a different painting or artwork with wildly varying styles.

Remember how you’d jump into paintings in Super Mario 64? It's like that, except each world is visually, stylistically unique from the last.  Time periods, artistic styles, specific artists, and even particular works of art are featured, with each world having its own set of unique challenges and goals.  Kandinsky, Lichtenstein, Monet, Kentridge, Dalí, Warhol; all of these could be unique experiences bridged together by a common element.
