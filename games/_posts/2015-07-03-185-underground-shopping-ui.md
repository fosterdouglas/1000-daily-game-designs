Iâ€™ve recently started working on the visual layout and design for a shopping menu for my iPad game, Underground.  See below for a .GIF of the current progress and images from different states in the design:

![Underground Shopping UI GIF](/img/games/185_Underground_UI.gif "Underground Shopping UI GIF"){: .img-contain }

![Underground Shopping UI 02](/img/games/185_Underground_UI_02.png "Underground Shopping UI 02"){: .img-contain }

It can be difficult to decide which information is most important to the player, especially at an early stage of design.
