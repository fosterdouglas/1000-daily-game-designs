A game where you have to guess which objects are in various types and sizes of pockets, just based on the outline they make.

Another option would be that the player is given a list of of pictures of what is in the pocket, and must spin and arrange them so they fit correctly.

(Yes, this is a Hobbit reference. + Thanks Madeleine!)
