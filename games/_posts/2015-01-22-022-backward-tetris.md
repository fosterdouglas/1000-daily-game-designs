In this Tetris mod, the game starts at the end of a traditional round and runs backwards.  The entire screen is filled with blocks, and the player must choose, remove, and sort the pieces correctly as they lift off of the board and float upward. The round is timed, and the player must dig through the pieces and reach the bottom of the level before time expires.
