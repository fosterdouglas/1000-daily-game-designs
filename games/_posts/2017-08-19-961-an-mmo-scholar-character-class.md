title: 961 An MMO Scholar Character Class
tags: mmo-game
---
An online RPG mechanic where instead of leveling up your own avatar, you are "teaching" other players or NPCs and leveling them up.

Itâ€™s in an MMO where veteran players are responsible for passing on what they know about the game, the world, and how to grow and progress. If nobody does this role, the world will fall apart. The player must choose to be a Scholar class, and devote their time to the greater good of the system.
