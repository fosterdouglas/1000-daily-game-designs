title: 561 The Save Item
categories: game-mechanic-system
---
An item in a game that allows you to save your game.

This is a one-time use item that allows you to save your game.  It would be a semi-rare item to find and have.  This mechanic in the game would change the way the player interacts with the game, based on whether a save has happened recently or there is a save item in stock to use if needed.
