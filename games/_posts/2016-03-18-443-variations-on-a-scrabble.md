Scrabble is one of the greatest games ever made.  Here are some variations of it:

**Scrabble Fire** - Basically, timed scrabble.  This probably already exists, but the rules are simple.  Decide on a time limit, examples tested include 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 5 minutes.  After an opposing player picks their missing tiles from the bag, start the timer for your turn. If you aren’t in the process of playing a word when timer sounds, your turn is skipped!

**Scrabble Shuffle** - This is barely a variation, as it pretty much nullifies most of the long-game strategy of regular Scrabble (thanks Madeleine…). In this variation, after each turn, pick 7 new tiles and then discard your previous 7. Every turn is like a surprise!

**Scrabble Babble** - May be best combined with Fire, in this variation opponents are allowed to use any means necessary to distract the concentration of each other.  All bets are off!

**201** - Each player starts with a score of 201.  Points are subtracted from this each time a word is played. The first person to hit 0 exactly wins. Words that result in a score of 1 or any negative number are not valid moves.

**Deleted** - In this variation, the board is set up with all tiles already placed on the board, in a specific layout, and face down.  Players take turns removing tiles from the end of "words," and using those letters to build faceup words for points.
