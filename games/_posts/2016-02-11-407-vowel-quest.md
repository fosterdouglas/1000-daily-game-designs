A web game that takes the text from any website and generates it into the level map for a top-down RPG.

On a given page, all of the consonants would form the basis of the layout of the level (using some sort of b=, c=, d=, etc system), while all of the Vowels form the enemies in the level (a, e, i, o, u, and I guess sometimes y?). Various other aspects of the site, like tags (H1, < b >, < p >, and others) would determine things like obstacles, treasure, resources, special rules, and abilities.

The standard "Story" mode would follow a set of websites that you take your character through.  Other modes would have recommended sites to input that could be used, or the player could input **any** other website.  Essentially, anyone who can design a website can design a level for Vowel Quest.

This idea is similar to [post 132](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/132-procedurally-generated-rpgs-using-books/){:target="_blank"}, although I’m not sure why I didn’t make the connection that websites are a near-infinite and much more accessible option for data input for the levels.
