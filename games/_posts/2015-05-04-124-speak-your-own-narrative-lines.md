title: 124 Speak Your Own Narrative Lines

When presented with a narrative dialogue choice in a game, say or type your own response instead of choosing from a couple of predetermined options.

The game would have to be play tested, and collect the top 100 or so responses to each dialogue encounter; the majority of players would likely say something similar to these responses.  The game would have unique responses back to each of them.  If the player uses a phrase that isnâ€™t recognized by the game, it will give a generic response instead (similar to using the incorrect item in a point-and-click adventure game).
