In this expanding memory game, watch an animated scene play out and then answer detailed questions about it.

The animated scenes could vary in length and complexity, but the goal is always to be paying very close attention to the details of the scene that aren’t so obvious.  The game might feature a "continuous" mode, which wouldn’t replay the same scene again until all other scenes have been seen, to discourage long-term memorization of scenes.  Each scene would have over a 100 or more questions available to them that would be picked at random for the player to answer.  The player wouldn’t ever see a repeat question unless they specifically chose the option to have that on.  There could also be a "repeat" mode that let you watch the same scene over and over , with the goal of memorizing it completely and mastering it.
