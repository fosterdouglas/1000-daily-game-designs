A game about growing flowers, designing beautiful flower bouquets, and eventually opening your own flower shop.

Like *Harvest Moon* or *Animal Crossing* or *Stardew Valley* (depending on when you grew up), except with flowers instead of vegetables and livestock.  Use the seasons, climate, weather, and more to grow and harvest your beautiful garden in bloom.
