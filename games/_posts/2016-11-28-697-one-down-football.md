A variation on [my variation](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/668-one-play-football/){:target="_blank"} of football. 

In this version of a version, the game has most of its rules unaltered from the standard version of American Football.  The main difference is that each team only has a single play to get a first down (a gain of 10 yards).  I think this could create an interesting dynamic, particularly in how the offense chooses its plays.

It’s typically safer to do a running play, but greater reward with a successful passing play.  Since the team only has a single play to achieve the 10 yards, I’d be curious what the strategy would be.
