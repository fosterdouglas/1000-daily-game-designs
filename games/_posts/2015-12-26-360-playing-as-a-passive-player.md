A game where you’re being protected instead of doing the protecting.

Often in games you play as the protagonist, the hero that comes to save the day during a dire situation.  In this game, you play as a character that’s in a dire situation.

Like, for example, playing as Padme/ Princess Amadala in the Star Wars prequel trilogy.  The story as seen through a non-action based character would be a completely different experience.
