A *Portal*-like game of puzzle solving in and out of mirrors.

In this 3D puzzle video game, the player is confined to a single room for each of the challenges.  Their avatar can walk, move objects, and manipulate other things in the room as normal.  However, they may also walk up to one (sometimes of multiple) mirrors in the room, look into it, and control their avatar’s reflection separately.  Many things the mirror-avatar does, also happen in the regular room, but certain rules would be established to make that clear.’

The puzzles would require a good amount of spatial reasoning, as well as the ability to navigate in the space normally as well as an inverted version of it.
