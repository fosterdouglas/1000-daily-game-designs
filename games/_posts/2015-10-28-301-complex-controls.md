On [Monday](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/299-delayed-input/){:target="_blank"}, I talked a little bit about an idea of having a purposeful input delay in digital gaming.  This week, I came across something somewhat similar.  The game *Super Time Force Ultra*(SUCH A GOOD GAME!), is a side-scrolling shooter.  But, it transcends those bounds by also being an interesting action/puzzle game.

I noticed right away that the developers chose to make the "shoot" button a controller thumb button rather than a finger trigger button.  I think it was a genius choice, and certainly one made on purpose.  The game isn’t a shooter really, it’s a smart puzzle game where you shoot.  So, keep the jump and shoot buttons right next to each other slows the player down a little, and forces them to focus on what’s happening on the screen more intently, rather than just running and spraying bullets like crazy.

It got me thinking about a potential mechanic that creates a complex and nuanced controller button mapping on purpose, to do something that might otherwise be easier to accomplish. Brainstorm time:

- A platformer that requires you to be holding different buttons depending on the color of your special ability, otherwise you begin rapidly losing health
- Every 10 seconds, the "Trigger" button changes.  This button must be held down for any other functions to work correctly.
- A mini rhythm game happening all throughout a different style game.  Press L and R in time with bass and snare hits.
- A driving game where L1 and R1 must be held down the whole time, simulating your two hands gripping a steering wheel.
