This mobile game is restricted to being played 1 minute per day.

But, itâ€™s designed to be enjoyed for that 1 minute each day.  Its focus is on long term play over the course of many months by discouraging compulsive lengthy single-session play.

The gameplay each day is, as Kevin described it, "a mad dash to get as much as possible done in one minute."
