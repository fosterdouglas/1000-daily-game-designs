This is a strange concept, but thought-provoking regardless.

How do we make (or play!) contemporary games with an idea of how they will be perceived in the future?

Hindsight is always easy.  We look back at the Playstation 3 launch titles, and remember being excited about them at the time.  Now, the majority of them are barely memorable outside of being launch titles to a revolutionary console generation.

Obviously thereâ€™s no way for us to know how something is going to be seen 10 years in the future, but I think that at least keeping the idea of this "looking back" in mind can affect some of the decisions we make, either in making games or in choosing which ones to play.
