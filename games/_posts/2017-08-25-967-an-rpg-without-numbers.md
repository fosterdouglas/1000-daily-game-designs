title: 967 An RPG Without Numbers

It’s my aspirations and dreams to create a fun and engaging RPG that has absolutely no mention whatsoever of numbers. No numbers!

I’m the first person to line up for a complex RPG, or to compare percentages and strategies and equipment loadouts in *XCOM*… but I’d love to see an RPG swing the entire opposite direction. There are some games, of which are currently escaping my mind, that have done this already, but it’s not common.

I think it could bring a strong organic or human viewpoint to a gameplay system. It would also result, potentially, in much less UI in the game overall (as discussed [previously](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/939-way-too-much-ui/){:target="_blank"} !).
