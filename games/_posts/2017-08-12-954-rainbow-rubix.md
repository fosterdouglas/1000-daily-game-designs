The game is the same size and shape as a standard Rubix cube, with a different goal.

The cube has 9 colors total, with 6 instances of each color (rather than the reverse, 6 colors total with 9 instances of each). The goal is to get each side with one of all 9 colors.

Technically speaking it’s identical to a standard Rubix cube, in that really the player is just trying to get a set of specific faces to a specific side of the cube.  But the difference is that there are multiple instances of a color (like Blue for example) that could in theory go to any side of the cube, and that each don’t immediately have a set specific side it needs to go to.

It might make for a pretty interesting visual puzzle.
