categories: adventure-game, narrative-game
---
A weird narrative-based adventure game set in the (very) small town of [Bedias](http://www.bedias.com){:target="_blank"}, Texas.

Share in the story of a young boy growing up in this tiny southern village during the 1920s.  Get to know some of the 200 or so unique and individual citizens.  Go to school, fall in love, get a job; live an average life in a simulated time period much different than our current one.
