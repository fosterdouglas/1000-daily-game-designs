title: 968 Degrading Skill Tree

Skill trees are a common system in modern RPGs, and are a great way to afford the player growth and choice for their characters. I’d love to see a system that brings a dynamic aspect to the skill tree. For example, if we’re using Diablo as an example skill tree, maybe nodes in the skill tree slowly lose power as you don’t use them as often. And, on the flip side, maybe the ones that the player uses more often are more powerful because of it. 

It would essentially be a "leveling" system for each node in the skill tree (something that’s been done before), but slowly losing power or effectiveness over time in the game.
