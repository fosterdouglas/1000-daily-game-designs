Or:

How to feel ok with not playing every game that’s ever released.

This is something that **every** semi-invested gamer has to deal with at some point.  There is always going to be more games to play than there is time to play them.  Even if you didn’t consider every game released from the moment you’re reading this backward, it would still be impossible for anybody to keep up with and play all future games as they release.

And of course, gamers have a built in achievement-hunting desire, which makes "playing them all" an even more alluring and obsessive goal.

I think the best way to combat this is to hone in on what it is you enjoy most about games or genres of games.  If you like short, focused, indie titles, then focus on those and really own that niche.  If you like long, sprawling, multi-month-long games, then do that.  And come to terms with the fact that some things will inevitable be sacrificed.

Or, if you’re like me and like both of those styles of game, then do your research very carefully before choosing games, and make sure you’re making the best of the time you do have.
