Why aren’t there games that are musicals?

The closet thing I can think of are rhythm games, of course, or something like *Persona 4: Dancing All Night*, which has a story that’s based around music and performances. But I’m sure if the tone were done well, a modern game could pull this off with no problem.

I’m picturing an RPG where I’m walking through a city center, but instead of overhearing random conversations, people are singing "lyrics" that are telling the story of the world.
