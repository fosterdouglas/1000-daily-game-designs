A sim game about crafting the most unnecessarily complex airport layout ever, while still making it technically useable.

Place items like checkout counters, escalators, moving walkways, security checkpoints, and restaurants in the most inconvenient places possible.  Increase the time it takes for a patron to get through your airport as much as possible without letting them realize it’s the airport’s fault they missed their flight.
