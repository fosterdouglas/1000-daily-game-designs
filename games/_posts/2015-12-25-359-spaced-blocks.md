A 3D version of Scrabble, using wooden alphabet blocks in the X, Y, and Z axises.

Each block contains letters on either 1 or 2 sides, the rest being plain colored sides.  Some blocks contain one blank, wood colored side.

The rules are similar to traditional Scrabble. Words are made using letters, in any visible and legible direction.  No word can be played if in conflicts with an already existing word or creates another ineligible one.

Larger block versions are for young children, and smaller blocks can be used by adults for making more complex words.
