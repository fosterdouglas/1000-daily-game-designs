Articles abound online about last year’s incredible action game, *Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor*.  Most of them shower it with praise for it’s groundbreaking “nemesis” system, and rightfully so.  It can’t be understated the impact this system will have on the game industry from a design perspective.  

Although the system feels like it was **designed** for the Middle Earth setting (oh wait.. I guess it was…), I can imagine it’s concepts being applied in a myriad of other ways.  Some initial ideas:


- Vendetta Chess; a game where dominated chess pieces come back from the grave even stronger and more strategically deadly
- In a *Dragon Age* type game, to manage family ties, alliances, and rivalries
- A brain training app that places the games your worst at as “War Chiefs” and other games you’re good at become rivals and battle one another to determine which becomes more challenging
- A sports game drafting system
- *Persona*-style relationship system, showing your NPC’s ties with each other. As you interact more or less with different groups, others notice and show interest, regress, abandon you, or form rivalries.
