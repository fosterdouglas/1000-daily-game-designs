So, there’s been a mouse problem at my house.

I wonder what it’d be like to play a game as a mouse, from that perspective.  Kevin and I were recently watch a Twitch stream of *Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Siege*, and there’s a portion at the start of each match where you get to drive a small micro-vehicle around for about a minute.  It had a very similar perspective to what I imagine a mouse might have.  Low to the ground, fast and frantic, and exploratory.

The game might be set in a single house, the goal being to infiltrate, infest, and set up your family inside of that house without being noticed, evicted, or exterminated.  Collect food for yourself, destroy walls and materials to build your nest, procreate, and feed your family to survive.  Other goals could include scaring, confusing, or pranking the humans that inhabit the house, preventing rival mouse families from invading (or allowing them to share the space), and staying healthy amongst fluctuations in temperature, food availability, and shelter.

This could also potentially be a VR game.
