more complex version of the japan cooking game board game

While I was [in Japan](https://notwanderlust.tumblr.com/post/158869161010/day-094-tokyo){:target="_blank"}, I played a cooking board game with my brother.  I forget what it was called, but it was adorable.  You had all of the pieces of a mini kitchen set, and an interesting mechanic where players had to make recipes and season them correctly and not burn the food.

Fake cooking is harder than it sounds...

It was designed for a younger audience, but Lance and I still had a blast.

I think it would be awesome to see an expanded version of this type of game.  More complexity and depth, maybe some sort of cooking RPG board game.  Iâ€™d call it **Cooking Quest**, obviously.
