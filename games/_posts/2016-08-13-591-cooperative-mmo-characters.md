A system of shared MMO characters.

In this system, somehow, a single MMO character is shared, traded, or passed on to another player.  The traits, level, experience, abilities, and other aspects would be preserved, while other things might be variable.

While the idea of the system seems a little obscure and random, I think that if it were done with a strong link to the gameplay, it could be really interesting.
