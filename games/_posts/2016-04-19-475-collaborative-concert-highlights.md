title: 475 Collaborative Concert Highlights
categories: music-game
---
A game/app that helps fellow concert-goers create a collaborative post-show video highlight experience.

Concert attendees use this specific app for recording any video or photos of the show they are attending.  The videos can later be automatically uploaded and compiled together by the service into a unique concert recreation.  Multiple points-of-view would be highlighted, audio would be optimized using best-available quality, and color/exposure adjusted for ideal matching between video clips.
