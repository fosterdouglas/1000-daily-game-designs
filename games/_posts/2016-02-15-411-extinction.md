An educational world sim game about preserving wildlife and monitoring the conservation status of species.

Like *XCOM* but without aliens, this sim game teaches players about conservation practices in wildlife sciences inside of an immersive and interesting gameplay experience.  Deploy different Conservation Scientists across the world to mitigate and reverse the effects of climate change, illegal animal hunting, natural disasters, and other serious situations.
