You play as a character who lives a normal life by day (you play a simulation game of where they work, like Diner Dash, Sim Coffee Shop, or Game Dev Story etc), but after work you are part of an elaborate real-life fantasy RPG.  You must work your way to earning money to fund your adventures, all whilst hiding your true passions from your daytime co-workers.  Explore dungeons! Fight monsters! Serve coffee!
