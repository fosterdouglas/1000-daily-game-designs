A 3D game all about interacting with your environment at **very** close distances.

This game could be about a character who has lost their glasses.  Or someone who is nearly blind.  The point is that everything in the world is obscured by blurriness until you get extremely close to it.

I think this could create some interesting environment interactions, and great opportunities for interesting puzzles and narrative moments.

There could maybe be an "ability" that the player could do, maybe only triggered by holding 5 or 6 different buttons on the controller simultaneously, causing the character to "cross" their eyes temporarily to gain slight clarity. 

This could also be interesting as a VR experience.
