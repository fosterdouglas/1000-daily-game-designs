A VR game about picking things up quietly.

The game gives you increasingly loud and cumbersome objects that you must pick up as carefully as possible, in an attempt to not create a distraction, be a bother, or wake up somebody, depending on the level and scenario.  The game’s tech would focus on very precise hand movements the player could use (with VR hand tracking, of course) to accomplish their great feats of quietness.
