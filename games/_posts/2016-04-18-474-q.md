A fast paced rhythm-matching memory tile game.

This game is like the classic memory tile game meets *Dance Dance Revolution* meets* Sound Shapes* meets a Lumosity brain training game. Or, like a drum machine synthesizer pattern matcher.

Many, many ideas in my head for this that are hard to write down right now.  Thereâ€™s a good chance we will develop a test of this game!
