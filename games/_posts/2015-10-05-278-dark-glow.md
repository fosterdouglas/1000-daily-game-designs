A card game played in the dark.

A quick google search reveals that WTF thereâ€™s no glow-in-the-dark card games out there? Or really any glow-in-the-dark games!?

This card game is played in the complete darkness. Or maybe only sometimes it is.

A magician and a thief have teamed up to cause some chaos during a local street faire. Collect your group of detectives and team up to use clues, deduction, and a bit of luck to track down the troublemakers and restore happiness to the bustling street market!

(More thought needs to go into this one.  But picture a two-cycle game turn of peace/chaos, during chaos all the lights in the room go out and the rules of the game change, using glow in the dark portions of different cards, and a dice set that rolls differently, and interactions between players work differently?)
