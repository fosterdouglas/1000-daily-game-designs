A game with infinite recurring "inception" depths.

It could take a meta approach, where the character in the game encounters a situation where they are the one playing the game inside of the game.

Maybe the controls of the game change somewhat on each inception, since each time the player is essentially obscuring one level further and playing a game of someone who is playing a game of someone who is playing a game…

And each time, the controls would either get more complicated, or more difficult.
