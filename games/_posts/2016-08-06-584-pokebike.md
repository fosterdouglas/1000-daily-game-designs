*Pokemon Go* is cool, but I wish that I could do something with it when I'm not just walking down the street.

This game creates markers on your local map for you to visit on your bike.  For the sake of the *Pokemon Go* example, let's say they are spots where you could catch a specific Pokemon.  You have a limited amount of time to get there before it disappears, and the game would somehow disqualify you if you used a car. (Maybe if the GPS knew you were going over 25mph?)

The game could give bonuses for getting to the location quickly (using your bike...), feature competitions against your friends, or have circuits to complete that have multiple stops on them.
