A board game where each person’s first turn is spent choosing a rule card for the game.  Each rule card has a general rule on it that dictates how the game is played, as well as a personal rule that’s specific only to the person with the card.  The personal rule is typically a large disadvantage that the player must compensate for throughout the game.  For example:

“Every time a card is played from your hand, you must choose and play a second card."

“The amount of money you currently have is always calculated backward. (for example, if you have 560 dollars, you actually have 065 dollars)"

“Whenever you ask a player a question, you must plug your ears before they give you their response."
