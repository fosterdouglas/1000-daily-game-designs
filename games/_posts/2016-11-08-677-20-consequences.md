A game of 20 questions with consequences each round.

For example, each round that you canâ€™t guess the answer, the player gets less words total to ask their next question with.  Or you have to take a shot of alcohol each round.  Or 10 pushups each round.  This things might motivate the player to ask more thoughtful questions each round.
