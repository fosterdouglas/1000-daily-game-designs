A add-on for Apple’s Messages app that tracks and gamifies your vocabulary use.

This app-for-an-app tracks all the words you type in Messages, catalogs the most relevant and popular ones, and after an initial profiling period, introduces games and challenges to encourage word diversification. It might work similarly to the upcoming emoji-suggestion feature in iOS 10, highlighting your most commonly used words in orange after you type them.  With a tap, suggestions for alternate words would be provided.

(Yes, another game where I take a word and then add "+" to the end of it.  I’M PREDICTABLE, OK!?)
