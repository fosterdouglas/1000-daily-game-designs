A non-interactive, dynamically generated digital location for people watching.

Like an MMO, except for watching NPCs interact. As you sit, you can see where other real people are, sitting and watching too.

Examples of locations: a train seat, a fountain at a park, a mall bench, a concert, a sporting event, or other large groups of people gathered.
