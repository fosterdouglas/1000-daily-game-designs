You’re a game designer who accidentally trapped her favorite character inside of an Alpha-state incomplete level editor for a game.

You can’t control the character, only the level and pieces inside of it.  Help your character make it through various intense situations by manipulating, hacking, and cleverly assisting inside the level, with only your half-baked level editor tools.

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Hand of Fate*** and ***Super Time Force Ultra*** and ***Professor Layton and the Last Specter*** ]
