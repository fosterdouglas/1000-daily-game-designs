Public Game Design Radio.

This is a radio station (or podcast, I suppose) that focuses specifically on the **game design** of contemporary and past video games, board games, card games, and so on.

The show would be very focused on the actual design, and wouldn’t make listeners feel alienated if they hadn’t played a specific game before.  It’s about dialogue of game design overall, and creating a shared language and vocabulary for the things we all experience as game enthusiasts.  It would also be short form and fairly light-hearted and funny.
