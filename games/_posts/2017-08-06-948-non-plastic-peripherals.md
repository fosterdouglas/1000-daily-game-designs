The age of plastic instruments and guitar hero has come and gone. But, there are always other opportunities.

What if, for example, a game came with something like a blindfold? In the case of the Switch, plenty of ideas (that aren’t fitness of music related) could be conceived of to attach the joy-cons to.

The idea is that the object can facilitate a unique experience that couldn’t be had otherwise.
