title: 538 MMO Player Level-Gap Interaction
categories: game-mechanic-system, MMO-game
---
This mechanic encourages high-level players in MMO style games to interact with and give support to lower-level and newer players.

In most MMOs, it seems like there’s such a large gap between what new and low-level players do and what the "end game" players do.  There has to be a way to bridge the interests of these two groups. And by "support" I definitely don’t mean the common act of a high-level player power-leveling a lower level character.  Maybe the high level character’s are forced to interact with lower one through a certain quest, one that’s mutually beneficial to both.
