In this sim game, the world's oil supply is down to the last 5 year's worth, and your coalition needs to decide how the following 5 years will pan out.

Prices for gas, solutions for transport, general energy needs, and so on all need to be addressed. The player would have many options about which types of alternate energy to focus on. The gameplay would be similar to a SimCity, or Roller Coaster Tycoon style sim game.
