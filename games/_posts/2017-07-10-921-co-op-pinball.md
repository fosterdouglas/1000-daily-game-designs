Two-player pinball!

The machines are linked at the back of each, and uniquely skewed slightly so both players can see each other a bit. Most of the standard tropes of pinball would apply, but with the added function of being able to pass balls through to the other player. Additionally there would be plenty of mechanics to play with where cooperation was required to accomplish certain goals, or aspects that one side of the duo could do to help the other side.

Forgive this quick and crude render:
