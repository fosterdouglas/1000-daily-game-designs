I’ve noticed a lot recently in game design trends, developers leaning on their assumption of their players’ past knowledge of gaming.

Maybe this happens with other similar creative mediums.  Can you create a film in a vacuum, without referencing things that have become the "rules" of film? Can you write an album of songs without thinking about how people have listened to other albums before yours?

There will always be somebody that plays your game as their first game they’ve ever played.  Think about that person, even just briefly now and again, to help clarify decisions about simple and straightforward game design.
