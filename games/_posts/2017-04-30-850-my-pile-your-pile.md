In this game, each player has a pile of something.  On their turn, they can take x amount from the other players’ pile.  The next player has a turn, and can take either 1 more or 1 less than what the previous player took.

The goal is to empty the other player’s pile. 

This isn’t tested and might not actually be a finite game.
