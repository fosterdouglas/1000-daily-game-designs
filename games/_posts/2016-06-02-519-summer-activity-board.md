A refrigerator game for planning family activities for the summer.

In this game, each family member gets a playing piece, and there's a shared game board pinned to the familyâ€™s refrigerator.  Points are awarded for fun summer activities each person does (swimming, basketball games, weekend trips, a picnic, etc.).  Bonus points are given for each family member you do it with, and everyone gets a bonus for whole family activities.

The game board has certain special spots and if you land on them you win fun rewards like ice cream days or road trips.  At the end of the summer, points are tallied and the winner gets a special prize (but all other participants get consolation prizes, obviously!).
