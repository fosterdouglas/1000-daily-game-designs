(Another) brain training game that helps teach spatial awareness and coordination.

Drive, maneuver, and park your 18-wheel semi-truck in various challenges.  The catch is, you can’t really see anything but what’s in your rear-view mirror and directly in front of you.  If it were a top down game, the concept might borrow from the wildly beautiful *Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine*:

Otherwise, the game may benefit from being a first person game.  Essentially, a view from the cockpit of a semi-truck.  The player must use their intuition, spatial awareness, and coordination to fit through and park their giant semi-truck and strange and difficult situations.
