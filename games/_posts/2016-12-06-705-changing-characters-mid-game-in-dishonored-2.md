title: 705 Changing Characters Mid Game In Dishonored 2
tags: game-opinion
---
I loved almost everything about *Dishonored 2*. But, right at the beginning of the game you’re forced to choose to play as one of two very different characters.

I love this in theory, and it’s awesome that it creates replayability in the game.  But, I was also kind of sad to be forced to choose one to play as (or really, forced to choose one to NOT play as), and seemingly miss out on the unique experiences that that character could bring to the game.

It might have been interesting if the game allowed the player to switch characters throughout the game, or if the story were crafted in a way where you bounced between playing the two characters.
