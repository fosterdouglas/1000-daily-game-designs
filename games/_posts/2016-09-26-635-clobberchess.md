In this mashup, the rules and board are used from Clobber, but the pieces (and their specific rules) are instead taken from Chess.

The board is 5x6, and every space is occupied by a piece.  Each player has 15 pieces of their color, down from the standard 16 used in Chess, due to the specifics of the board size.  One pawn is omitted from each player’s set of pieces.

The players place their pieces down in a specific set pattern for Classic ClobberChess.  Alternatively, the players can agree to a custom game where they take turns placing their pieces in spots of their choosing until the board is filled.

Clobber rules apply, and the first person who can’t make a clobber on their turn loses.

(Based on this game [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobber){:target="_blank"}, and Chess obviously)
