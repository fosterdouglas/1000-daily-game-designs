Today my brother and I finished our play-through of *Broforce*. 

All I can say is… Wow.

We had fun with it overall, but it was definitely the kind of game that you can only really play for about 20 minutes at a time before it becomes too much, at least for us anyway.

It’s a balls-to-the-wall, over-the-top, button-mashing, screen-exploding, word-hypenating experience, through and through.

Somewhat recommended.  11 out of 17.
