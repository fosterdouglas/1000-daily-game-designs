title: 539 An Emotion Trait In An RPG

This mechanic is used to describe an "emotional state" that a character is in.

I saw recently during a play through of *Final Fantasy VII* that the characters had the "sadness" trait.  I think that in the game it’s just another state that the character can be in, like poisoned or silenced (though I’m not positive).  But, it made me think, what if there were an entire emotion system for characters.  The things you do in the game would affect your mood, and in turn your mood would affect the way you interact with the world, other characters, and so on.  It’s like a more realistic version of a good/bad morality system!
