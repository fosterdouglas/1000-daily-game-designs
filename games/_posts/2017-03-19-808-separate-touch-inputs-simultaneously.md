An experimental game focused on the unique hand position of using both a trackpad and a touch-bar at the same time.

Some ideas on how this could work:

- The trackpad is used for vertical movement of some element, while the touch-bar is used for horizontal movement
- The trackpad is for rotation or some circular movement, while the touch-bar controls some linear aspect
- In a rhythm game, maybe the trackpad is used to follow the beat of the game and move it forward, while the touch-bar is used to move your character or some other aspect left and right
