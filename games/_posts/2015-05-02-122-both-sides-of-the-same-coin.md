title: 122 Both Sides Of The Same Coin
categories: puzzle-game, rhythm-game

This digital puzzle game uses two analog sticks to line up and organize different shapes inside two radial boards.

Two circles side by side, with each controlled by the playerâ€™s left and right analog sticks.  Each have tracks on them which can be synchronously toggled through and selected using a single button.  As the the analog sticks are spun, the shape on the track spins around to match the location.

Both circles represent a single medallion, so the puzzles must be solved by using the two sides to interact with each other. It may also work as an rhythm game. Very vaguely similar to the new indie game *Sentris* by Samantha Kalman.
