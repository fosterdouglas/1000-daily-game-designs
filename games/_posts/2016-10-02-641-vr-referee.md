Play as a VR referee.

Assume the role of a VR referee in a football/soccer/baseball game.  Look around to spot fouls, inconsistencies, or rough play and call them out correctly.  If you call too many things incorrectly, the fans and players of the game start to revolt against you and your embarrassment level will go up.

Also, you must actively avoid players/balls otherwise youâ€™ll get knocked out, also increasing your embarrassment.
