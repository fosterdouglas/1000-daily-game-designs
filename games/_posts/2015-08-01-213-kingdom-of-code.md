A series of reward-driven mini-games that help teach coding languages at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.

Like *Professor Layton*, but with coding challenges instead of brain teasers.  The game would start basic, but escalate quickly and adapt if the player is clearly a more experienced coder.  As each challenge is completed, the player earns experience toward a self-set reward, as well as bonus Tokens that can be used during challenges to request hints.  The player is only rewarded with these Tokens when she completes a challenge without the aid of any hints.  Some exercises are timed which can also incur additional Tokens or experience.
