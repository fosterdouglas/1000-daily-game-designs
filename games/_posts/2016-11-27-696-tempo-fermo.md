A game about freezing time.

I’ve always loved when games incorporate a mechanic of slowing or freezing time.  It’s interesting because it’s something we could never experience in real life, but is really fun to think about.

I’d love to see a game that uses it in other interesting ways besides just freezing time and letting the player walk through it.

Because, it introduces a really unique and interesting perspective for the player.  They’re given additional time to process a situation that would otherwise happen in a split second.  So, because of this, the game can feed the player more information and give them more choice, since they are afforded more time to digest it.
