A game about making secret references to Rent.

The goal is to make a reference to Rent out loud around your opponent, without them noticing.  If they donâ€™t acknowledge that the reference was caught within a minute of it being said, the player gains a point.  Rentferences must be direct quotes from either the musical or the film adaptation of the musical, and must be full lines, not just a snippet or portion.

Thanks Madeleine!
