title: 220 Blanket Strategy and Compounding Strategy

It seems like there are two types of game-wide strategy progressions,  blanket strategy and compounding strategy.  Blanket strategy is a game system that sets rules from the start, and alters the situations and interactions around them as the game moves from level to level.  Compounding strategy is instead when a new element is introduced into the system each level or periodically.

Blanket strategy examples include classic games like chess and checkers, and modern games like *X-COM: Enemy Unknown*, *Fire Emblem*, and *Civilization*. This is defined by the fact that **all the same strategies are available from the first game through to the last**.  In other words, you could solve the final level of a game using the tactics and skills you had during the first level.  Most modern board games have blanket strategy, as well as many turn-based strategy video games.

Compounding examples include *Candy Crush*, *League of Legends*, *Kingdom Rush*, and most real-time strategy games. The basic definer of these is that the **fundamental strategies required to progress depend on rule changes, additions, or enhancements over time**. That is to say, you couldn’t use strategies from the first level to finish the last, and vice-versa.

I’ll revisit this topic in the future, as it is slightly half-baked.  Also, to discuss which type of game is a superior experience, in my opinion. :)
