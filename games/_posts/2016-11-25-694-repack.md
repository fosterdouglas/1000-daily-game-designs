A (brain?) game of repacking things.

The challenge here is to see something complex and be able to recreate it.  So, the level might be a tightly packed suitcase that needs to be repacked, or a fancy electronic device that needs to repackaged.  Maybe it would be a stylized game visually, but would still focus on arranging and stacking, in particular order, to complete the level.
