Great, another bird-themed game.

I’m on a roll with my consistent themes lately.  Birds and maps.  Oh! A bird-map game?!

Pigeon Dodger is a simple yet exciting mobile gaming experience.  Swipe left or right to dodge angry pigeons that fly directly at your head.  Use items like bread crumbs and bird feed to control groups of pigeons while you carefully sneak past.  Careful not to accidentally kill any pigeons or you’ll also have PETA after you, too.
