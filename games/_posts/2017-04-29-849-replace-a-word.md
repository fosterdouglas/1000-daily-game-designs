This brain game gives you a sentence and a single word, and it’s the players goal to figure out a single word in the sentence that the given word should replace.given a sentence and a single word, figure out the single solution for which word it replaces.  For example:

Sentence: The banana hasn’t fallen far from the tree.
Word: Broken

Maybe you are also allowed to add one point of punctuation anywhere to help. Or maybe not because a comma could make this way easier.
