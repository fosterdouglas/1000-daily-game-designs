An app with games specific to individual cities around the world.

For example, *City Games: Tokyo*, or *City Games: Chicago*.  Each app would have activities and games specific to these cities.  Scavenger hunts, bar or restaurant crawls, iSpy activities, walking tours, or coffee shop adventures.  Some of these would be cooperative activities, and others would be competitive or single-person games.

The goal would be to have a wide range of activities, some of which would appeal to city natives and others to tourists or visitors.
