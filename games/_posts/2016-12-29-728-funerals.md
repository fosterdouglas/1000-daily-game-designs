A game mechanic where you have to go to the funerals of each person that you kill.

I’m pretty sick of the desensitization of death in video games.  With this mechanic, your character would be forced to take time to go to the funeral of each person they choose to kill in the game.  It doesn’t matter if they are a "bad" guy, they still had a life and a family and were a person.

Ok, so they weren’t "a person" because they’re in a video game.  But, in theory!
