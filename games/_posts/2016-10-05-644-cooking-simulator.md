A full-blown food simulator.

This incredibly complex game would simulate the reactions, combinations, and processes of 100’s of common food types being cooked and prepared.

I’m not sure how feasible this actually is, but it would be incredibly useful if you could interact with and experiment on virtual food. Undercooking, overcooking, burning, searing, melting, boiling… all of these processes simulated with some of the most common food types to allow a test run on a recipe, or just to experiment!
