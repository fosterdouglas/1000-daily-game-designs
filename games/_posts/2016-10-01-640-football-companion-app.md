In this football companion app, guess which plays the coach will choose next while you watch your favorite team play.

This game is played on an iPad or iPhone during a live football game.  It sync with the game you are watching, and allows you to pick upcoming plays moments before the snap.  It also allows some fantasy-football style things, like guessing the final score or the outcome of certain challenges or situations.

The player gains points throughout the live match, and can compete on a national level or just locally in the same room with someone else.
