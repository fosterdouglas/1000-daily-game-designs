A game that assigns you a digital pen-pal based on your location.

Set your location, and the game searches the direct opposite side of Earth from you, matching you with the closest other player to that location.  The game is based on this one-to-one interaction with this remote buddy, although texting/chatting would likely not be the primary form of communication.
