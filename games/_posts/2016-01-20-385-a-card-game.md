A card game about learning the identity of one card; truly, a card game.

Two cards are picked from the deck by one non-player person, depending on where they are sitting.  The two cards are placed back to back and held up in the center. Players on one side can see what card is on their side, and players on the other can see theirs.  Players must ask questions and deduce things from the opposite team to try and guess what the identity of the card.  Each player has a single guess, and is out of the game when their guess is used up.
