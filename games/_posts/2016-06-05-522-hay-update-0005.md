We’re hard at work on *Hay*, and below you’ll see some of the documents I’ve written up for potential rules and variations of the game.

```
#Hungry Hungry Hay-po

**Cow (2)** - Walks one space, can't move backward. Can't move or be moved once eating hay. (Can push other animals off their hay?)

**Pig (2)** - Moves only diagonally, up to two spaces. (Can roll in hay?)

**Chicken (2)** - Can only run in straight lines, continues running until it hits something. (Can jump onto adjacent hay?)

**Sheep (2)** - Hops over one space, in 4 main directions.  //Can move twice if there's nobody else adjacent.

**Horse (1)** - May move freely around all surrounding spaces of the Farmer. //Can eat up to 2 hay bales per game.

**Farmer (1)** - Can move one space in any direction, but is vulnerable to [something?].

**Total Hay (14)** - 2 hay owned by each player, and 12 hay lined up in the center of the board.

##Goal
The goal is to be the first Farmer to either feed all 7 of your animals, or eliminate all of the other Farmers' hay.

Each animal on your board can (and must) eat up to one hay bale; //the horse can eat two but only needs one.

##Strategy
In this variation, you must spread your animals out in such a way that they can all get to a hay bale to eat.  You must also keep in mind protecting your own stock of hay.  You may eat one of your own hay bales as a strategic move, but not if it's your last remaining bale.

#Hay Hungry Horse

**Cow (2)** - Can move one space in any direction, including diagonally.

**Pig (2)** - Can only run in straight lines, continues running until it hits something.

**Chicken (2)** - Hops over one space, in 4 main directions.  Can move twice if there's nobody else adjacent.

**Horse (1)** - May move freely around all surrounding spaces of the Farmer. Can use a turn to eat an adjacent hay bale.  Will not move unless near the Farmer.

**Farmer (1)** - Can move one space in any direction on his/her own, or two if paired with the horse.

**Total Hay (6)** - 3 hay bales by each player to be placed anywhere on the opponent's half of the board. 0 hay bales placed randomly (not necessary maybe?).

##Goal
Your horse is picky; it only likes eating hay bales made by the neighboring farm.  Feed it 3 bales to satiate it and win the game.

##Other info
Each animal type on your farm can be frightened by one different type.  Cows are frightened by chickens, chickens by pigs, and pigs by cows.  If you end your turn next to an animal different than your own kind, it will either be frightened, or it will frighten you. When an animal is frightened, it will immediately move in a random direction one space.

Once an animal is frightened it will be uncontrollable and continue to move one space randomly each turn, until the Farmer is adjacent to it to calm it down.

##Strategy
Use your animals to scare the opponents, causing chaos on their side of the board.  Find efficient ways to move around with your farmer and horse and eat the hay as quickly as possible.

#Hay Bale Collectors

**Cow (2)** - Can move one space in any direction, including diagonally.

**Pig (2)** - Can only run in straight lines, continues running until it hits something. Can push hay 1 space.

**Chicken (2)** - Hops over one space, in 4 main directions.  Can move twice if there's nobody else adjacent. Can stand on top of Hay?

**Horse (1)** - May move freely around all surrounding spaces of the Farmer, and is able to carry hay bales. Can move 3 spaces per turn on its own. Cannot pick up hay bales on its own.

**Farmer (1)** - Can move one space in any direction, with or without the horse. Is able to load a hay bale onto the horse.

**Total Hay (6)** - 6  hay in the center of the board.

##Goal
Collect enough hay to feed your farm's animals.

The horse and farmer are the only pair that can carry Hay, and must retrieve 4 bales to win.

During your turn, the horse may move freely around all surrounding spaces of the Farmer.  If you end your turn with a horse on a hay bale, the horse is then carrying that hay bale.

##Strategy
Move fast to collect and store hay in your farm's barn.  There are only 9 bales left in the field, so it might come down to a race for the final bale!
