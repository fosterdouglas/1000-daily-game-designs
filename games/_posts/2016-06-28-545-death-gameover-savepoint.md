I was watching a streamer play the new *Star Ocean* game today, and noticed that, as it is a classically designed JRPG, it still utilizes the common Death-GameOver-SavePoint system that was invented over 30 years ago.

While I won’t do hours of research to determine whether this is accurate, it’s my assumption that *The Legend of Zelda* on the NES was likely one of the first games to implement this type of system.  If a game didn’t use Death-GameOver-SavePoint, then it probably used Death-GameOver-Restart. There are a few others… SecretCode-Death-GameOver-SecretCode… Checkpoint-Death-Checkpoint… and so on.

(The theme here is death and rebirth.  If there’s any theme that has pervaded video games since the beginning most, it’s probably death {or guns/shooting} {or jumping}.)

So why are we still using these systems? Well, we aren’t really.  A lot of contemporary games, and **many** indie offerings, attempt a great number of other solutions to get around the Death-GameOver-SavePoint system.  And for that we applaud them greatly!  JRPGs like *Star Ocean* rely on this system because it’s comfortable and familiar.  It gives the player some control over how they mark progress in their game, and it introduces a consequence loop that motivates player decisions (if my character dies right now, I’ll have to start back at the SavePoint! O no!). But I’m not convinced that these same advantages can’t be achieved some other way.

I don’t have a solution necessarily, because it’s a pretty big question.  But it’s definitely on my mind why these systems persist through the decades of gaming evolution.
