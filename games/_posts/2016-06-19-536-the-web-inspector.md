This web game mechanic requires the player to dive into their browserâ€™s "inspector" mode to turn on and off elements of the page to solve problems and puzzles.

As a basic example, certain information could be in the code of the website, but hidden using commenting ( the double backslash / / ).  The player would have to inspect the page to bring up the panel, and find that part of the page to check it on, displaying information that would help them move on to solve the puzzle.

More advanced uses of this could be devised, and possibly even be ultimately used to teach web design.
