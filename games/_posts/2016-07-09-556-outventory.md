An RPG that focuses on removing items from your inventory as much as possible, rather than collecting them.

So many games focus on **collecting** as the main goal. In this game, the goal is reduction.  You shed things from your inventory, as the game continually adds things or as you accumulate them.

As Kevin called it, **Marie Kondo: The Game**.
