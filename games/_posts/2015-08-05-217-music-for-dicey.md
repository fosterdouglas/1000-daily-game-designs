In [post #215](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/215-dicey/){:target="_blank"}, I conceptualized a brain training game about counting dice.

I've since started making a prototype of the game, with my partner in crime, [Kevin](http://kevinmcgillivray.net){:target="_blank"}.

I wrote a first draft of music for it.  It didn't turn out at all the way I had hoped.  But, it's a first draft, and [everything has to start somewhere](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/001-legend-of-korras-disappointing-control-scheme/){:target="_blank"}.
