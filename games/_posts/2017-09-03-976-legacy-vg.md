A game mechanic that prevents the player from EVER replaying the game again after you’ve played through it once.

There are numerous blocks to making a system like this feasible. It would have to be implemented in a way that was relatively fail-proof. For example, not just using emails to sign up for a game, as players could easily (and definitely would) just sign up multiple times with different emails.

Maybe the player has to request a one-time-use key via snail mail to an address, and they can only receive one per address (although what if multiple people in a household want one…).
