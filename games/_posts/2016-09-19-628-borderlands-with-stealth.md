I really want a game to exist that blends the feeling of the *Borderlands* series with the stealth of something like *Dishonored* or *Thief*.

What I mean is, I really love the action and gameplay of *Borderlands*, but I want to be able use more strategy during encounters.  I don't like when the only strategy is "use as many bullets as possible."  Stealth is what first comes to mind to balance it, but I'm there could be other options.

I also like the idea of portions of a cooperative game being stealth focused.  So, it would force both players, or the entire team, to work very closely together to achieve a goal with a little more fineness and precision than is typically normally of games like *Borderlands*.
