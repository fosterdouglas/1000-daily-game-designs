Here’s a (cynical) list of game design tropes that I may or may not endorse:

- Fast Travel
- Potions
- Double- and Triple-Jumping
- "Leveling Up" as a term
- "Experience Points" or "XP"
- Points
- Hit Points
- Lives
- Score
- "Attack" and "Defense"
- Pause
- Upgrade
- Skill tree
- … and so much more!
