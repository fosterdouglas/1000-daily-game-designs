Eventually, I want to start a live streaming channel to talk about game design.

I think it could be a great medium to dissect and discuss game design with an audience in real time, while playing the game.

The focus would be specifically on diving deep into mechanics and systems of a game, and getting audience involvement, opinion, and discourse about it.
