As you collect a resource during this endless runner / puzzle game mashup, it charges up a special pair of Time Traveling Shoes that your character is wearing.  You can use this time reversal at any time, and many parts of a level require it to solve certain puzzles. Like *Braid* meets *Bit.Trip Runner 2* meets *Canabalt*.  The levels are not generative; they are carefully and expertly designed puzzle levels.
