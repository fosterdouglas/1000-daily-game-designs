title: 695 Travel Agent The Game
categories: simulation-game
---
The more I travel, the more I realize how absolutely impossible the job of a travel agent used to be, before the internet.

And even still now, with the internet, it’s a difficult task.  The less constraints you put on your travel schedule, the harder it is to plan it.  It’s like increasing the variables in an equation… each time you add a variable, the possibilities increase exponentially.

Ok, maybe not exponentially, but by a large margin.

In this simulation game, you’re tasked with satisfying the most obscure and pickiest of vacationers.  Make sure they have a good time on vacation by planning accurately a variety of activities that pique their interest, as well as things that go out of their comfort zone.

Various challenges would include a newly-wed couple, a family of 6, a couple on their 50th anniversary vacation, and so on.
