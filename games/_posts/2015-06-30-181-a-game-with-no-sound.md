A game with no sound.

This game encourages you to play it while listening to something else, like music, podcasts, an audiobook, or even a movie.  It’s designed specifically as an experience that can be shared with another. We drive cars and listen to music, we work while we listen to podcasts, and we eat while we watch movies.  Maybe there’s a certain type of game or experience that can still be fully enjoyed while listening to something else simultaneously.
