A 3x3 physical cube, similar to a rubix cube, with a single letter on each face instead of a color.

Instead of a goal that has a set pattern to attain (like the rubix cube), this object has various tasks to try and complete, each of which is different every time, depending on the starting state of the cube. Mission examples might be: spell a certain word across the top or bottom of the cube, get all the letters of a single kind onto one side, make all letters alphabetical, and so on.
