A card game where infinite feedback loops make infinite sense.

Using a set of iconographic playing cards, the player must race to build infinite loops quicker than their opponent.  Each of the cards can have one or more icons in its four corners, each of which correspond to specific rules and ways that that card can be used.

The cards can be layered and overlap in multiple different ways, creating a string of processes, and eventually loops as the game continues.  Larger loops are rewarded, and players also have opportunities to steal the other playerâ€™s loops, or link into them.
