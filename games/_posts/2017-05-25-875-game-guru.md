A trivia game specifically about video game releases.

The game would show a photo of the cover of a random game, and present the title of that game.  The player would then have to type or select the year they thought it was released.  There could also be more difficult modes that ask the player to guess the platform(s) it was released on, or guessing the title based on the cover (with the name blacked out).
