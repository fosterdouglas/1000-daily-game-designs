Do you paint, write, compose, cook, design, think, or create in some way? (If not, are you human?) ;)

This is a game that’s designed specifically to inspire you in those other areas of your life. Fire it up when you’re feeling particularly uninspired.

Inspiration, **it’s well known**, is not magic. And when you’re in a rut, google (/google images/the internet) can only get you so far. This game is specifically designed to create positive and unfamiliar neural connections in your mind, opening up **opportunities** for inspiration. Creating opportunities for you to find and feel inspired is the best way to actually get there.  There is no magic formulae or step-by-step instruction guide you can use; this game simply engages your mind in unique and unexpected ways, creating new connections and a healthy breeding ground for inspired ideas.
