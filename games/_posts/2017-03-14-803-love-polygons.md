In this game, create the most complex and far reaching love-triangle style relationships you possibly can.

One person loves another person, but this other person likes one of them, and a fourth person likes the same one but has a significant other already, who happens to be secretly a lesbian.

You know, these crazy real-life situations that can’t possibly be real but are.
