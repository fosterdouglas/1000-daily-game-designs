A game of team Archery.

Three people stand in a line, aiming a single target.  The goal is to create a specific size or shaped triangle on the target. The team captain counts the team off, and they release their arrows simultaneously.  The round is graded on accuracy, shape, precision, timing, and uniformity. The game could be scaled to any size above 3 by just changing the shape goal on the target (a square, pentagon, hexagon, etc).
