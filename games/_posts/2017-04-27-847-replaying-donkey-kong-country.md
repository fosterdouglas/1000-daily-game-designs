I love this game.

And not in that annoying "omg nostalgia automatically makes me gush unrealistically about how amazing this game once was."

But in a real way.  Itâ€™s a wonderful platformer, it has fun music, and the activity and level design is dynamic and interesting.  And of course, the art style is wonderful and at the time was incredibly unique and revolutionary.

And surprisingly, replaying it now it still holds up.  Mostly.
