A tool/game that helps you pack and prepare for long term vacations or traveling.

Input your list of packing items, and a rough estimate of the sizes of your luggage.  The tool will then guide you through the best way to pack these things, if it will all fit, which things are allowing in carry-on or checked luggage, and estimating its weight.

Get a head start on your packing weeks ahead of time and avoid any nasty surprises!
