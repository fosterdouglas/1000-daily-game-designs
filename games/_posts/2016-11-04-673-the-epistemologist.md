A game about knowledge.

This narrative adventure game features a protagonist on a search for a person known as The Epistemologist. 

The Epistemologist has been known to be the most intelligent person alive, by a ridiculously large margin.  He/she has invented a collection of devices that have made enormous impacts on many different industries around the world.  He/she has recently fell off the grid ("gone missing" wouldnâ€™t be an accurate way to describe it, since he/she is known for being reclusive).  The protagonist is involved in finding him/her.
