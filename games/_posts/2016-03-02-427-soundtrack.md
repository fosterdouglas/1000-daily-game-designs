A narrative game where you control the soundtrack.

Like *Heavy Rain* or *Beyond: Two Souls*, but instead of controlling the character, you control the soundtrack.

This game would focus on presenting a world where music and sounds change the feeling and outcome of everything.  Much like in life, outlook and disposition can be powerful forces on their own, and so music as an analogy for that is used.

The actual interface used for control/creating the music isnâ€™t yet clear to me, although it would be something unrelated to music composition creativity, and more focused on the impact and purpose of music in our lives (and in our media).
