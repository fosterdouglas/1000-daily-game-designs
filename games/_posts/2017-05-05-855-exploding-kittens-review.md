title: 855 Exploding Kittens Review
tags: card-game, game-review-critique
---
I played this recently with a group of 6 total people.  I have very little background experience with The Oatmeal in general, and also a fairly low amount of information in general on the history of Exploding Kittens.  All I remembered about it going in was that it was a card game that made a massive amount of money on Kickstarter.  

I’m here to report, sadly, that I enjoyed almost nothing about this game.  It’s not that it was a **bad** game necessarily.  There was just nothing interesting about it.  I think that it may have been riding pretty heavily on it’s "shtick" of being cat/Oatmeal themed.  I can’t actually imagine a group of people that enjoy deep and interesting and rewarding games enjoying this.  I could **maybe** see a group of friends that enjoy superficial one-off fun things to maybe enjoy this for a brief moment.

Man, this is a harsh review.  Do better next time, game designers.
