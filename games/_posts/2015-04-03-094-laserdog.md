Attach these interactive vests to all of your neighbourhoodâ€™s dogs, and play a friendly game of LaserDog!

Monitor your dog from your iPad wirelessly! Your dog gains points when it comes close enough to another dog, if it barks, and if it does various tricks. It is given positive feedback in the form of vibration each time it gains points.  Try to train your dog to be the neighbourhood's friendliest dog!
