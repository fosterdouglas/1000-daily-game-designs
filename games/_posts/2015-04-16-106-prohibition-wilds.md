A spirits-smuggling adventure game set in 1929, recounting a single night's exploits of a famous smuggling gang during the peak of Prohibition in the United States.

This adventure game takes the simulation genre and mashes it up with point-and-click adventures and first person shooting.  The shooting mechanic in the game is very much secondary, and is in fact build to make aiming and actually hitting things much more difficult, as it is in real life.

The game has absolutely no UI, and encourages exploration and business management.  Time passes in real-time, allowing you to experience the entire gameâ€™s single-night experience across a 12 hour adventure.
