The spiritual sequel to *Alto’s Adventure*. Actually, not at all.

In this game, you’re a cat with the sole goal of destroying everything in the house that you possibly can.  Play the Rush Mode to destroy as much as possible in 60 seconds.  Or, play the Campaign where you’re goal is to last as many years as possible, slowly destroying all the important things in your owner’s house, but not noticeably fast enough so that they return you to the pet store.
