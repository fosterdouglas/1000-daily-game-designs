A puzzle that's built vertically upright instead of flat on a table. The puzzle is made out of custom colored lego pieces.

The challenge in this, versus a traditional puzzle, are the different tactics required. For example, you can't necessarily build the border of the puzzle first. Or, that the puzzle pieces have many different ways to fit now, instead of just 4 sides like traditional pieces.

The puzzles could either be flat (like a wall), or the more complex ones would potentially be three-dimensional in some way.
