This is an adventure game masquerading as an RPG.  Instead of playing the heroes of a traditional Final Fantasy style game, you play the NPCs. 

Essentially, you follow along the story as three people in different cities of a fantasy world, receiving exposition only by overhearing various bits from the heroes as you see them, or as you talk to people that have seen or talked to the heroes.  You can swap seamlessly between all three characters (like *Grand Theft Auto V*, or *Broken Age*) at any time, to track and follow the interesting lives of the heroes.
