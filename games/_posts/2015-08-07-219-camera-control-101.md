A free interactive web tutorial to help teach inexperienced gamers how to use the ubiquitous dual-input control standard.

One of the largest barriers to entry for non-gamers into first-person and third-person games is the control scheme.  It’s hard enough as it is to learn a game’s specific unique control scheme, but if you’re also battling with understanding how general control tropes work, it can be beyond frustrating.

The tutorial would begin with basic, obscured exercises and mini-games that introduce the concepts of *left-stick-move / right-stick-look* in a fun and frustration-free way.  As the player becomes more comfortable, they’re eventually introduced to a standard first-person game, and finally to a third-person game environment.

The tool would also be available for free on consoles.
