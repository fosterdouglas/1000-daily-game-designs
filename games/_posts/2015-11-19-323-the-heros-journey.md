A game about stories, why we tell them, and why we tell them how we do.

This semi-educational game presents the ancient methods of storytelling, which have recently been exhaustively analyzed by author Joseph Campbell.

The game follows the 12 steps of the Hero’s Journey, as outlined by Campbell.  However, it takes a slightly more literal and educational approach to presenting it, rather than the implicitly standard narrative.  It gives the player a chance to experience these "steps" one by one, see how they relate, and why exactly they make for great storytelling.
