Visit your local grocery store virtually first, plan out your trip, and avoid unnecessary costs and purchases.

Major grocery store chains like Trader Joes, Whole Foods, Safeway, Kroger, or Publix could provide detailed maps of their store interiors and product layout.  This would be used to virtually recreate them, allowing players to enter the grocery store from the comfort of their homes.  Players walk through the store, grabbing things and putting them in their cart as they would in real life.  However, the game could provide money saving suggestions, recipes, and health tips along the way.

When the player is finished, the "checkout" process includes an estimated total of the groceries, and options to export the data, either as a grocery list, to your phone’s various list apps, or as a viewable or printable map, indicating where each of the items you picked out is located.

Additionally, though unlikely to actually work, the game could partner with grocery stores, allowing a player to pay a convenience fee for a store employee to gather these items for you and have them ready for pickup at a specific time of the day.

This would be a great implementation of VR, although it certainly wouldn’t require it by any means.
