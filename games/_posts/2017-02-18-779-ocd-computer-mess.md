title: 779 OCD Computer Mess
tags: funny-game, puzzle-game, simulation-game

A puzzle game where you’re given a strangers computer and tasked to completely organize it. 

You play as an employee at a massive company, a somewhat faceless cog in the corporate machine.  But something sets you apart from your fellow faceless cogs… you’re manically obsessed with organizing other peoples’ computers.

Put your OCD skills to use, organize files and folders, applications, settings, and other aspects of your target computer, all before the person returns from their lunch break, coffee break, or meeting.  Time it carefully so you can work on multiple computers throughout the day, making progress on your ultimate goal to ORGANIZE EVERYTHING EVER.
