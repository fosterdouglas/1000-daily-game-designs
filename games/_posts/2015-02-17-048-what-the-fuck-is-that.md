Cranium style game where youâ€™re shown a picture of something hyper-enlarged, and have an extremely short time to guess what it is.

Each player draws six picture cards, each with hyper-enlarged photos on them.  One category card is placed face up in the center.  Each player can show one or more of their cards to one or more other players, for up to one second. If the opposite player guesses correctly, the card is given to them and put in their stack.  The player with the most cards at the end wins.
