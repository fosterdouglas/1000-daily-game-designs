A game about matching colors amongst similar tints and shades of it.

The player watches a countdown in the center of an all white screen. At the end of the countdown, a medium-size circle of a given hue appears in the center, and simultaneously a few other smaller circles appear scattered across the screen, of variously similar tints and shades of the center color.  The smaller circles only stay up on the screen for a very brief flash.

The goal is for the player to be able to identify which of the smaller circles is the identical hue to the larger center circle.
