title: 799 Better Typing With The Touch-Bar

I’ve been curious what other utilities Apple’s touch bar could be used for, other than the standard built-in things that it does now.

I’ve had a [few](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/797-breakout-invaders/){:target="_blank"} different [ideas](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/798-depleted-update-0001/){:target="_blank"} already for games, but I think it could be used educationally, too.

This idea would have to be tested technically, but I wonder if the laptop camera could be used to track the positions of the hands on the keyboard by tilting your screen down toward the hands (so the screen can’t be seen).  Then, although the main screen can’t be seen, the touch-bar is still clearly visible.  On the touch-bar could be shown typing exercises and routines that help to teach typing.  It could help to point out incorrect hand placement and keystroke use.
