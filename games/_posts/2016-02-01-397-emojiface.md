A simple but addictive game of emoji face matching.

One potential set of rules would flash a grid or partially incomplete grid of emoji faces on the screen. The player is given a very short amount of time to study it:

![emojiFace1](/img/games/397_emojiFace.png "emojiFace1"){: .img-contain }

They must then identify the emoji face which there was only one of, by clicking the blank space where it once was.

![emojiFace2](/img/games/397_emojiFace_2.png "emojiFace2"){: .img-contain }

This could also easily be adapted into a Memory version of the game, where click these blank faces would flip them over, and the player has to find matches.

Another potential rule set could be that the player has to find the one smiling face in a group of non-smiling faces, or slightly smiling faces (similar ideas found [here](http://baldwinlab.mcgill.ca/labmaterials/materials_BBC.html){:target="_blank"} and [here](http://www.lumosity.com/){:target="_blank"}). Or, the player needs to click all of the same face as quickly as possible.  **Or, after the faces disappear, click all of the target faces that had appeared.**
