title: 863 Dividing Addictive Games Into Digestible Chunks

I think it’s a game developer’s responsibility to make a game that is mindful to the players’ time invested into it.  Games are an addictive medium, and can pander to the addictive qualities that have evolved in gamers.

It’s an important quality of a game to have chapters, dividers, breaks, or other mechanisms in place to, at the very least, avoid players feeling forced into continued play.  Of course, choices will always be made to continue a play session, as long as there are measures in place to **allow** players to stop when they want to. 

This has also become slightly less of a problem in recent games, since all modern consoles now allow the player to "sleep" games at essentially any moment they need to.  This doesn’t apply however to any online or multiplayer games.
