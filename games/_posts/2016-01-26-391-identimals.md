A game about identifying visually similar species or genus of animals.

The game presents a set of 6 animal photos in a grid, as well as a question, for example "Which of these photos is a bonobo?"  For those of you who know your primates, you’d likely know immediately which one is a bonobo.

The game would focus on educating players who don’t know many of the answers, and introducing more difficult challenges to those players who seem to know many of the answers.  Education could also focus on other facts about the animals, for example where they’re typically found, how dangerous they are, if they’re endangered or extinct, or if they can be found in zoos.
