How well do you know the streets of Manhattan?

Take the ultimate challenge: label all of the streets and avenues on the island of Manhattan. In Easy mode, names will light up green if typed in correctly on the correct street.  For Normal mode, the grid’s intersections will light up green after both directions are filled in if at least 1 of the streets is correct.  In Hard mode, no indication or hint is given as to correctness until the player is finished. In these 3 modes, spelling is forgiving.  In Extreme mode, even spelling mistakes count against your score.
