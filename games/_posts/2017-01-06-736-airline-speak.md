A game where you must comprehend the enigma that is the airplane pilot intercom voice.

I think I posted a similar concept to this, except it was related to dentistry tools.  In this game, there are very important instructions that you need to follow, and they are, for some reason, being delivered to you via the airplane intercom.

The levels would vary in difficulty depending on the pilotâ€™s voice, the amount of other noise in the cabin, and the type of directions the pilot is giving.  

What the directions that would be given for could also vary drastically.  Instructions for a puzzle, how to exit the plane, what to do to operate the TV screen at your seat, etc.  Bizarre and mundane things would be best!
