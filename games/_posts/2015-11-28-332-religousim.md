Craft your own unique religion and spread the word of your views across a simulated Earth in this ReligouSim game.

Your goal is to design a unique religion and attract followers.  Some scenarios may ask you to achieve a certain % of global recognition or followers, and others may focus on creating a meaningful and deeply transformative religious experience.

As your religion spreads and gains popularity, opposing religious groups will try to discount and disprove your claims, claiming theirs to be right and converting your followers to their religion.  Situations arise that will test your moral compass and force you to make difficult decisions. Use money, power, persuasion, love, or malice to grow your religion!
