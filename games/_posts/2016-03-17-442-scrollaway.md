A fast-paced word hunt.

Gameplay might be similar to *Puzzlejuice* for iOS.  Players must find words hidden amongst a seemingly random sea of letter tiles.  But, the tiles are consistently scrolling upward or downward out of view.  Maybe similar to *Tetris*, there would be some state that indicates failure, too many letters fall off the screen or get backed up or something. The layout might not be completely random, players might have a specific set of words that they are looking for during a given level.

Levels could also have different themes related to clouds, air balloons, rain drops, or other things that are constantly in motion upward or downward.
