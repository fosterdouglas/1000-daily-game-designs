A rock-paper-scissors modification.

In this variation, the players choose moves ahead of time for a 9-round game.  This leads to less immediacy, and maybe more strategy, or maybe it would be completely arbitrary.

Theorizing about it, I can imagine making strategies against another player, especially after a few initial first games.  You wouldn’t want to do 9 scissors’ in a row, multiple games in a row, or your opponent will catch on to your method.

This might be totally stupid in practice.
