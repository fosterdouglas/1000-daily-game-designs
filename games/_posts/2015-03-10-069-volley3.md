Volleyball played with three teams instead of two.

The court is a perfect circle split into three equal pieces, with a pole at the center and three nets expanding out from the pole to the edge of the circle.  Team sizes are reduced from the standard six players down to two to four players per team. 

Once the ball is served and in play, a team can volley back to either side of their choice.  Points are calculated differently. Each team starts with 18 points, and loses a point each time they fault.  When all points are lost, a team drops out of the game, and the other two teams continue playing.

Most other standard Volleyball rules apply.  Serving rotation is done clockwise.
