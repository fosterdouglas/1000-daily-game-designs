A game about holding hands and becoming closer to the person youâ€™re connected with.

A mix between old quiz gameshows like *The Newlywed Game*, board games like *Battle of the Sexes*, a cool and sassy iPad app called [Fingle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fingle/id490109661){:target="_blank"}, plus the lightheartedness of something like [MASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASH_(game)){:target="_blank"}. All played while holding hands and sharing a controller.

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright*** ]
