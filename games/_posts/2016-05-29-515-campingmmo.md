An MMO about casually surviving in the wilderness for a weekend.

This game is not about surviving some sort of horror situation with zombies or monsters or murders.  You choose a group of 1 to 5 other people to bring with you for the "weekend" duration of the game.  Choose strategically what supplies to bring based on the space you have in your cars/vehicles, the number of people in the group, and the money you have to spend.

The weekend is spent setting up campfires, fishing, hiking, foraging for plants, exploring, making food, and playing sports mini-games.
