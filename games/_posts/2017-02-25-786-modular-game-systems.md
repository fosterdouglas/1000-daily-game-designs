title: 786 Modular Game Systems

A game system that allows components of the experience to be added or removed at well, either for preference, difficulty, or accessibility.

This is somewhat like the official "mod" support we’ve seen in Bethesda games like *Fallout 4* and *Skyrim*. Although often modify or build upon existing game structures, this system would be designed from the beginning to be pieces of a game that  could be added or removed to directly alter the experience. 

For example, if it were an action RPG, maybe the entire "skill tree" system could be added or removed from the game, to alter the complexity.  Or, the number of enemies in the game could be significantly altered.

It’s somewhat like an "RPG Maker" style game, but maybe more focused.  Like, that there is something interesting and high-quality already created with that Maker, and gives the player the tools they need to alter it if they choose.

What these pieces would look like would be entirely dependent on the specific game and the genre, but the concept remains the same.
