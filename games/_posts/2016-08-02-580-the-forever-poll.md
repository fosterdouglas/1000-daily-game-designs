A Forever-Poll is an online poll designed to ask similar basic questions to people over the course of 100’s of years.

Example questions:

- How often do you do your laundry?
- How many books do you read per year?
- How much money do you make?

And so on.  Questions that will hopefully produce interesting data over the course of many 100’s of years.
