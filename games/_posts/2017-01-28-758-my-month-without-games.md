During half of December (2016) and half of January (2017), I put exactly zero hours into gaming.

It might not sound like a big deal… but when you take gaming culture as seriously as I do, it definitely is.

That said, it wasn’t as affective of an exercise as I thought it would have been.  I started it initially because I was busy traveling, and thought it would coincide well with that.

Maybe it wasn’t difficult because I was busy as it was, with plenty of other things to do (work), and see (travel), and read (books!), and consume (pasta…).  I never found myself craving it, or wishing I were doing it instead of something else.

I don’t think this say much about how much I enjoy gaming, but it could maybe be interpreted that way.  It’s just like anything else we ever do, it ebbs and flows, it comes and goes with the changing tides of our busy lives.

So if you’re a gamer, try it out some time!  Or don’t!  Just be sure you're aware of how your most-often-done activities affect your daily life.
