title: 859 Halo Reach Review

Kevin and I have a long history of trying to play and complete *Halo: Reach*.  It’s been a struggle, especially with Microsoft’s  (sometimes/anecdotally) ridiculous Xbox Live platform.

We finally got a chance to play it together, locally, and completed it.

Of all the *Halo* games, and this isn’t saying much honestly, I had the least trouble following the story in this one.  It was surprisingly straightforward for Bungie, and that is a welcome change from the convoluted and densely packed narratives of the previous entries.

The gameplay is pretty consistent with the other *Halo* games, as was the level design.  Nothing surprising or revolutionary, but also par for the course with *Halo* quality.

I’m looking forward to playing *Halo 4* to see how the series evolves with a new developer.
