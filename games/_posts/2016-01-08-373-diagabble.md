Scrabble played diagonally instead of vertically/horizontally.

∏∏∏∏∏∏∏∏∏∏**G**  

This Scrabble variant is incredibly difficult. Letters can be played only diagonally, but words can form diagonally, horizontally, and vertically.  In the above example, the word **BEST** was played first, followed by the letters for **OOLONG**, which also formed the words **SO** and **TO** horizontally.

I like this idea much more in theory than in practice, it wasn’t all that fun when tested out.
