A game of Scrabble using differently colored tiles.

In this game variation, youâ€™re given a set of standardized letters (not 100 like Scrabble, probably less).  They are different colored for each person (either the wood is, or maybe just the actual letter).  The rules are similar to [BananaScrabble](){:target="_blank"}, except that instead of the goal being to get rid of your tiles first, the score is counted at the end and the person who scored the most points wins.
