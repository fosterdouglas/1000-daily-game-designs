I wanted to write about this article, and about the book it references. Unfortunately, the book is too expensive to justify buying.  $65, really? Sorry, maybe next time.

Instead, I'll write a future post about the four types of video games, as made up by me.

(Based on this article [http://kottke.org/16/10/the-four-types-of-board-games](http://kottke.org/16/10/the-four-types-of-board-games){:target="_blank"})

[ Today I Was Playing: ***Invisible Inc.*** and ***Borderlands 2*** and ***Witcher: Enhanced Edition*** and ***Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time*** ]
