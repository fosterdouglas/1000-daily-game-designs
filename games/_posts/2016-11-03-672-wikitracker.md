A game/app that datafies and gamifies your interactions with Wikipedia.

Or maybe it just tracks it.  But I think it would be incredibly interesting to have a personal profile and data set of all the pages you ever visited on Wikipedia, how you got to the page, and where you went from it, and how all of this data relates to itself.

Not much of a game there really, but maybe.
