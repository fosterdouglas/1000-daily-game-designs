A name-hunting game that can be played during the credits roll at the end of a movie.

One player starts by saying "I spyâ€¦ _____" and then fills the blank with a name from the bottom of the screen.  The other player has a short amount of time to find the name before it scrolls awake.  If they find it, they say "credit!" and it becomes their turn.

(Thanks Madeleine!)
