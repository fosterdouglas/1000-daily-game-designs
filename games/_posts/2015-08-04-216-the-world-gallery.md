Enjoy digital recreations of popular art from the world’s most prestigious galleries, in VR.

Similar to Google’s [The Art Project](http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/about/artproject/){: target="blank"}, except instead of photos, the sculptures, installations, and artworks are recreated digitally with extreme detail.  Walk through galleries at different times of the day and year, and even meet up with friends to explore and discuss together.
