title: 364 Making Job Interviews Slightly Less Terrible
categories: brain-game, experimental-game
---
This brain game helps train you for the difficult mental stresses leading up to and during an interview for a job.

Using various zen techniques, breathing and health routines, and prep questions and exercises, this game prepares you for what some consider nearly the worst possible experience to have, maybe only second to public speaking.  After using this game for the week or so leading up to the interview, you will feel more relaxed, prepared, and genuinely most likely to be yourself during the big day.

Donâ€™t blow it, be prepared for your interview by practicing ahead of time!
