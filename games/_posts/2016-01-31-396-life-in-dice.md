Place sets of custom dice near areas in your home or life that you commonly visit.  Examples could be near the sink used for doing dishes, close to a common reading spot, next to a patio chair, or near a toothbrush.  Whenever you visit this spot to do a reoccurring activity, roll the set of dice.  Do whatever the activity is with the alternate suggestion from the dice roll.  For example, the dice could roll "Take Your Time" or "In Under 5 Minutes."  The options could also be more specifically custom to each activity, like "Read every page twice" or "Sing while you wash the dishes."
