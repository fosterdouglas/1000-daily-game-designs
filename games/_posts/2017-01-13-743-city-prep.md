A game that helps you prepare for your visit to a new city.

We all get excited when we have future travel plans, but are we doing everything we can to prepare for the trip and to get the most out of the experience?

The gameformation experience (term patent pending?) helps with just that!

Play through various mini-games and puzzles to help you prepare for your visit.  Learn about the areas you’ll be visiting, get a head start on familiarizing yourself with the map of the area, public transit options, currency, tourist destinations, non-tourist destinations (!), and more.

Don’t travel blindly.  Prepare yourself with City Prep.
