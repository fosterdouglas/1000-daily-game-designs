*“The question is not what you look at, but what you see.”* - Henry David Thoreau

A cooperative-only experience about the perspective of oneself vs others’ perspective.

In this game, you can see information about the other person that they can’t see themselves, and vice versa.  The information available is hard to describe with words, and therefore must be communicated to each other using other methods and concepts.

Like *Journey*, but less about telling a story, and more about revealing truths about the perspectives we hold of ourselves and others around us.
