Compete with your peers in a friendly game of find-the-dog!

In this game, take pictures of dozens of breeds and color of dogs. Race against your friends to spot (and capture) all the breeds!  Various challenges can be unlocked, as well as specialty quests (for example, take a picture with 3 different dog breeds in it, or 3 same-colored dogs in itâ€¦ etc).

(Best played in a populated area that supports a healthy dog community!)
