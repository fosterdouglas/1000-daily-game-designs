Played in an indoor low-gravity sphere, this space sport uses magnetic boots and hollow discs.  The goal is for one team to throw the discs through a thin (1 foot tall) but long (30 feet wide) opening on the bottom or top of the sphere.  Each slot is guarded by 2 players.  There are 5 additional players on each team, making for two teams of 7.
