A game (or… tool?) that takes input from Twitch (like audio or visuals), and remixes and alters it somehow. I could see it being used as an abstract art-making tool or some VJ content. I just think it would be ripe for this type of use, as there’s so much variety of video/audio data on Twitch, as well as it being live.
