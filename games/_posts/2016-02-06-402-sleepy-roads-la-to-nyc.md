A game about staying awake while driving across the country.

In this "endless" (not endless) "runner" (driver), the goal is to stay awake as long as possible while driving your car across the U.S.  When it’s nighttime, the player has to focus primarily on staying awake, but also must stay on the road and drive safely as normal.  During the day, sleepiness is slightly less of an issue, but increased traffic, distractions, and other problems appear in its place.
