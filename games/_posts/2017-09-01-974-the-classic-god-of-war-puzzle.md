title: 974 The Classic God Of War Puzzle

In the original *God of War* games, the puzzle design varies in quality, although never deviates from being generally enjoyable.

There are generally various amounts of portals, switches, platforms, and statues to push and pull. Sometimes the puzzles are great and engaging, but sometimes it feels like the player is just spending time figuring out some hyper-specific mechanic that the game hasn’t yet revealed to the player that they’re already able to do with abilities already available. It can feel a bit enigmatic, but maybe by design.
