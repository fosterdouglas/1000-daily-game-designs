Design, edit, test, and be challenged to create various escape routes as efficiently and safely as possible.

The player would be in control of where the flow of people goes during an emergency, as well as other environmental factors, but would not be in direct control of any of the people moving around.

Different levels would include trains, planes, apartments, office buildings, restaurants, hotels, houses, amusement parks, and so on.

The goal is to get as many people to safety as possible during the emergencies, while minimizing chaos as much as possible.
