This computer plug-in monitors your email, messaging, and other typing to analyze your common word usage.  It then uses that data to encourage you to expand your vocabulary by learning new words and meanings, as well as showing you places that you could have instead used the words in your past messages.  It could also be used just as a way to track data and look at it, if one were interested in what words they used most or least often.
