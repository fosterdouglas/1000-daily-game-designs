I came across this word recently and thought it was incredibly fascinating: Ecumenopolis.  I’m still not positive how to say it correctly, but it essentially means a "world city" or a city that’s as large as an entire planet.

A couple of games in the past have explored ideas like this, most memorably *Destiny*.  But it didn’t go at all into detail about how that world become one giant mega-city, or what types of interactions that creates with the citizens and with the nature of the planet’s actual biology and fauna.
