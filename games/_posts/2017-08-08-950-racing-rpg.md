Why aren’t there more traditional RPG systems in racing games?

For example, if *Mario Kart* rewarded the player with "loot" as you interacted with certain parts of the course during the race, or bumped into other players.  Then, between races, the player could use some of this loot to improve their kart, weapons, or player character in some way.

It’d be like *Diablo* meets *Mario Kart*.
