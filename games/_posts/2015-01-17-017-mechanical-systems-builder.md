Using an array of pieces, you're able to build and simulate complex mechanical systems. Examples would include pulleys, doors, hinges, tracks, levers, gears, pedals, hammers, belts, and all other mechanical-based aspects of machinery.

The machines can be built based off of blue prints, or you can use the sandbox mode to build basically anything. 

The fun and appeal of this type of "game" may be slightly niche, but I think depending on how the blueprint system is implemented (and progression, from simple to complex), it could have a more broad appeal.

Relating it to things already existing, it's kind of like The Incredible Machine meets LittleBigPlanet meets Minecraft, meets autoCAD.
