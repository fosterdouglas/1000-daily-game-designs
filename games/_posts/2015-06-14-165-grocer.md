A game/app that helps you catalog and manage what’s in your refrigerator and pantry.

To simplify management, every time you have a meal, snack, or drink, just text the provided phone number with @foodname #status. For example, @milk #1cup or @milk #halfleft.  You can also make preset meal combos, for example, @hamsandwich #2 would mean you made two ham sandwiches, using the ingredients you typically sue for a ham sandwich.

The interface would make it simple and fun to manage what’s in your fridge, help you decide what to  get during your next run to the grocery store, and how to save money by cutting out and optimizing certain items.
