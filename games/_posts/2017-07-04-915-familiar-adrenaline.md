A gameplay or storytelling mechanism used to elicit an experience of adrenaline, specifically adrenaline from a situation that has already been experienced.

Most of us have had the feeling when you’re watching a movie you’ve seen multiple times before, or for whatever reason already know what’s going to happen, but still get the adrenaline rush from the experience.

There’s plenty of research suggesting that this is a sort of spoiler-dubunker in ways. In theory, neurologically speaking, it barely matters whether you already know the ending, the journey to get there is identically exhilarating.

I’d love to see this recreated with intention, approaching a game design system from the ground up with a specific goal of trying to create familiar adrenaline.
