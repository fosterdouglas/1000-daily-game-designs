A game to help children safely and effectively get a healthy amount of exercise, even when circumstances require them to be indoors.

In Go About, the goal is to find and use different objects in the house in fun and aerobic ways. Finding these objects and figuring out what to do with them requires creativity and ingenuity from the child. Pots and pans, water jugs, boxes, and other moderately heavy objects could be used as a fun alternative to "weight lifting." Finding a safe but effective way to run around, or play with a ball or other object to encourage movement could be another option.

The main goal is to get your child to use creativity indoors while still being safe, having fun, and getting healthy exercise.
