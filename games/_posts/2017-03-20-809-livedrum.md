An accompanying VR game for your electronic drum kit.

This could be something as simple as a clone of the *Rock Band* drum system, or something much more realistic, and challenging, more similar to the *Rock Smith* setup for guitar players.

The game could place you in the "shoes" of the drummers of a variety of bands, letting you live a more realistic simulation while playing along to one of the bandâ€™s tracks.

Small sensors could be added to (or built into custom) drum sticks for realistic tracking.
