A few days ago, I [posted](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/588-a-revision-of-archery/){:target="_blank"} my thoughts on a how the sport of archery could be improved.

Another option in addition to that is something a little more technical and maybe specific to the olympics.  A way that the sport could eliminate entirely the use of numbered "zones" would be to measure every arrow that’s shot by the distance in centimeters it is from the center. So instead of the points system being based on zones of 7, 8, 9, bullseye, etc… it would be based on the amount of centimeters the arrow is from the dead center of the target.  So it would switch to a "lower is better" point system, with the best possible shot being a Zero.

This switch would allow for much more precision in competition and would nearly all but eliminate any ties in scoring.
