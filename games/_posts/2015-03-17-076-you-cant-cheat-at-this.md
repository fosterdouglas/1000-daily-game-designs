This game system is designed to prevent people from making a guide or FAQ to help others chat at completing the game.

If for example the puzzle has a specific number used to solve it, then ensure that number is randomized.  If there are certain AI patrol routes of some sort, make multiple versions of those, and make sure that is randomly chosen per game. Things like that.

The goal is not to discourage or prevent people from finishing the game; the point is to encourage people to use their brains on their own, and spend time in the game world solving puzzles and interacting with the elements of the game.  Itâ€™s ultimate focus is to improve engagement and overall realism.
