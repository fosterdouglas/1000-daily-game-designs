A game designed to occupy children while their parents are busy at the laundromat.

The laundromat isn’t a fun place for most kids; children need to be occupied while their parent gets down and dirty with cleaning.  With this fun, self-monitoring game, kids can effortlessly skirt the mind-numbing boringness of the laundromat!

The concept is vague currently, but it would involve the child using listening skills to assess the environment around them, searching the laundromat for different articles of clothing and colors, and reporting to their adult with various clues and pieces of information. Like iSpy + Clue, kind of.
