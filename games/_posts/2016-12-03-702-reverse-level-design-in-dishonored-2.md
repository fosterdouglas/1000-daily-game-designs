title: 702 Reverse Level Design In Dishonored 2
tags: game-opinion

One aspect of *Dishonored 2* (er, actually maybe the first game did this too but whatever), is the reuse of level design.  As in, when you get to the end of a level, and achieve your "objective," the game doesn’t just acquiesce.  It says to the player, "good job doing the thing you needed to, now go back to where you came from."

It’s realistic, and it makes sense.  The game doesn’t just fade to black and allow the player to move on.  You are the character, and you do everything the character needs to do to get to the places they need to go.

I love it.
