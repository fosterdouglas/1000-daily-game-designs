Speedrunning is a unique aspect of the gaming community.  I love that it takes something that already exists, and gives it a completely new purpose.

I’m curious about the future of it, though.  Many players seem to enjoy most speedrunning older games.  They’re in general more glitchy, more manipulatable, and just have a characteristic that’s different from most modern games.

Are modern developers creating games that encourage people to speedrun them? Maybe some.  I first think of the Dark Souls series, which has a large community of people running through the game with various self-applied challenges or limitations.

Browsing the website [speedrun.com](speedrun.com){:target="_blank"}, there are **mostly** games being played from the 90’s and 2000’s.  Not a lot of really modern things, although some.

I hope developers keep in mind this practice that many players enjoy doing, and ensure that their games at a minimum don’t discourage speedrunning as a possibility.
