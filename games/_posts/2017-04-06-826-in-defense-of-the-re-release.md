I know that I’m not the only person on this side of the argument, but **let’s stop with the remake bashing**.  Publishers (usually) and developers release remakes/re-releases because historically customers have purchased enough of them versus how much they cost to produce.  It’s an obvious business decision.

Generally, these projects aren’t in replacement of the developer making new content.  Often even, the project is passed on to a different but capable developer to do the conversion/update.  The companies that release remakes that perform poorly tend not to release more of them.  It’s a self-regulating commerce-based system.

So quit bitching about it!  Don’t buy the games if you don’t want to play them, but understand that some people do.
