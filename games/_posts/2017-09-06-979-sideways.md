A game that you have to play laying down sideways looking at the TV.

Maybe it’s kind of like an iPhone game, the portrait-style ones, where you’re moving upward or downward through levels, but it’s oriented that way on the TV, despite most people’s TVs being in portrait orientation. The player could probably play it without actually laying down or turning their head, but it’d be more interesting if the game encouraged them to actually play that way.

More interestingly might be something more experimental, something that could only be played sideways somehow, or took advantage of the inherent limitations/benefits of laying sideways.
