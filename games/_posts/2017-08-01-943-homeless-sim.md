Making an experience that translates the stress and difficulty of being homeless is idea I’ve pondered on since playing *Beyond: Two Souls*, the chapter where the protagonist finds herself living in a homeless small camp).

I think it'd be incredibly hard to design and develop this with sincerity and intention, especially without ever having been in that same position personally. It’s a sensitive topic and might be difficult to convey or tell a story that doesn’t seem emotionally manipulative or degrading.

That said, if some of that could be tackled properly, I think it could be an incredibly eye-opening and affective experience for players.
