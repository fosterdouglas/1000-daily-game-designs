A food game about teaching the differences between perishable and non-perishable foods.

It can sometimes be difficult to explain to children the way food spoiling works without showing them first hand.  This game helps better illustrate what time (and preservation, or lack of) does to food.

The game has a section for the kid’s fridge, as well as the pantry. Once a week, the kid can go "grocery shopping" inside of the game, and pick out many different fruits, vegetables, and other items.  Then they can decide where to place them in their panty/fridge.  Once placed, the items begin to age realistically depending on the conditions.  The player can come back later to see what happens to different foods over time depending on how they are stored.  Alternatively, a "speed up" button could be included for less patient players.
