A 22-player competitive online game with each person playing as a part of an (American) football team.

The game is played in first person view, using a VR device.  Players must contribute to the team’s overall success in the same way that a real game of football requires.  Plays will be called, routes run, and catches made.  The VR helps to increase the player’s sense of surroundings by giving them a virtual peripheral vision, which would likely be key to the realism and excitement of the experience. Other than the VR headset, the game is played with a standard controller, and mimics some of the familiar traits of current football games.
