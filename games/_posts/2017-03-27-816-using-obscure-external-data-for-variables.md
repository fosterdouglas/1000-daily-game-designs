title: 816 Using Obscure External Data For Variables
tags: experimental-game, web-game
---
A web game that uses bizarre external data as variables for gameplay.  For example:

- The number of pages visited that day on Wikipedia
- Top Google’d words or web buzz words of the day, week, month, or year
- The kb/s of your internet speed
- Your ip address
- The number of keystrokes you’ve made since the game has been opened
- Your computer’s model number
- Any other random and not-too-creepy data that a website can access about your computer or internet connection
