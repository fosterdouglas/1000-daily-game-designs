A collection of minimal touch-screen games played by using only your thumb.

The collection would include:

- A online competitive *Thumb Wars* simulator
- A dynamic music generator and koi pond simulation hybrid; drag your thumb to make music **and** splash water
- Timber; a fake-but-real-but-fake Tinder clone for hipster lumberjacks
- Thumb-a-Mole
- One Thumb Billiards; play an entire game of pool with just your thumb
- MetroKnown; tap your thumb to a given Beats-Per-Minute and test your tempo guessing accuracy and time-keeping consistency
- Logger; one-thumbed and lumberjack-themed *Frogger* clone, to keep you busy while youâ€™re not using Timber
