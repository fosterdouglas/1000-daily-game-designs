A game where you compete at being the best at arguing.

An interactive conversation simulation, similar to the conversations in BioWare games, but instead focused on successfully arguing.  It’s important not only what you say, but also when you say it and timing.  You can interrupt the other person, but do it too much and they’ll get frustrated and give up on the argument.  Interrupt too little and you’ll be overrun and flustered, losing the argument.
