A game that helps you learn and recognize rare and unique fruits and vegetables.

Itâ€™s important for children to learn early in life about different food groups and nutrition, and be able to identify different fruits and vegetables.  This game would bring this type of educational information into a fun, interactive environment.  Using an iPad or tablet, children would explore different locations around our Earth, collecting (and learning about!) all the types of foods that grow in these different areas. They would be encouraged to go with their parents to the grocery store, and take photos to help them identify, remember, and complete challenges the game has around certain foods local to them.

The game would also focus on how these foods get transported around the world, stored, and eventually consumed by us.  Basic recipes and cooking processes would also be featured.
