Players compete world-wide to translate sentences into emoji.

A web or tablet/mobile application that presents the player with a sentence in their native language and asks them to translate it as accurately and succinctly as possible.

For example:

"The dog has to pee."

May translate to:

![TerraMoji](/img/games/315_Terra-moji.png "TerraMoji")

Players can vote on the best translations for other sentences as well.

An alternative mode may be where the player sees a string of emoji and has to translate its meaning back into their native language.
