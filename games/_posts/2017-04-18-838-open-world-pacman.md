I’m not the world’s [biggest fan](http://www.foster-douglas.com/games/158-freedom-in-open-world-narratives/){:target="_blank"} of open world games.  I’m not against them, it’s just that they don’t often appeal to me immediately.

But maybe a *Pacman* open world game would change my mind.

(probably not.)

Stop me if this exists already, but it might be interesting for a *Pacman* game that is **much** larger than they have traditionally been.  Maybe there aren’t dots and ghosts everywhere, but you still have these traditional corridor-style levels.  And you would look for upgrades or solve puzzles and find bosses.  Like, the original *Legend of Zelda* except with corridors and a always-moving-forward little Pac guy.
