Based on dream I had, a dragon breathing a gas that crystallizes into a pink and white crystal rock substance.

It’d be hard to describe in words, but I have a very vivid mental image of it. I think what I like most about it is the idea of a dragon not being strictly "ice" or "fire" or "lightning" or something typical like that, but of some element of basis that’s more unexpected and unique.
