title: 907 Happy Aphelion

I like this for a title of something.

But additionally, the idea of aphelion (the point at which an orbiting mass is furthest from the thing it is orbiting) is an interesting concept. A world could be built around this concept, maybe some earth-like place that has a bit of a wider orbit around its sun, and so for some parts of the "year" are much further from their sun, bringing a harsh and unforgiving climate. In that world, the aphelion would be something to be feared, a representation of the most extreme moment of this cycle.
