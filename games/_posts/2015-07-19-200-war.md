A free, one-time World War III MMO of warring countries that only lasts until one faction dominates. 

This high-stakes online game is only available to play as long as at least two factions are still at war.  Once peace (and death) has been achieved, the game is done and shuts down permanently.  The game design would be balanced in a way that it wouldnâ€™t end within the first few days of it being live. 

If only few people play, or even nobody, the NPCs will eventually finish the game.
