An experimental game, played in the complete darkness.

The player must navigate an abstract space thatâ€™s completely shrouded in blackness.  Sound is used primarily to move around, the player may press a button to create a clicking sound that will resonate differently depending on their environment.  Other environmental sounds and feedback will help give context to the space.

For atmosphere, the game heavily encourages the gamer to play in a completely blacked-out room, but is reassured that the game is in no way a horror-type experience.

Kind of like a reverse version of *The Unfinished Swan*.
