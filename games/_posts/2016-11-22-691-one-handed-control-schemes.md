title: 691 One-Handed Control Schemes
categories: game-hardware

I’ve always thought that some games were particularly well suited to feature a one-handed control scheme.  I have a childhood memory of watching my brother play *Final Fantasy Tactics* (or maybe it was some other *Final Fantasy* game?), and during the more mundane stretches of the game, he would play it using just his left hand, using the opportunity to rest his right hand or to take a drink of something or have some munchies.

Depending on the game, this can work well.  Holding a Playstation 4 controller, for example, in your left hand you have access to the analog stick, the 4 directional buttons, L1 and L2, and the analog stick button L3. That’s a solid amount of buttons that can be smartly implemented in ways that allow alternate control.
