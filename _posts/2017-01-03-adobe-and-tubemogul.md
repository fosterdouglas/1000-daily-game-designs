With Adobe (and originally with TubeMogul, before the acquisition), I was a visual designer and producer on a long-term contract.  Most of time was spent creating digital ads and mocks for a wide range of brands and clients.  I worked on over 130 different projects over two years, collaborating with other designers, developers, and account executives.
