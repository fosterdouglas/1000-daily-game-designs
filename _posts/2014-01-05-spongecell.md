At [Spongecell](http://www.spongecell.com), I had client-facing interactions with a variety of companies, brands, and agencies.  I was a lead producer on one of the company's largest clients, [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com), and helped reimagine the production process and workflow, as well as redesign creative assets. Other brands I worked with include [Disney](http://www.disney.com), [Air New Zealand](http://www.airnewzealand.com), [GM](http://www.gm.com), [Scion](http://www.scion.com), and others.

I used primarily HTML5 and Flash to produce interactive ad placements, and tools like [Asana](http://www.asana.com) and [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) to collaborate with the product, engineering, and sales teams, as well as for general project management. Check out their [gallery of ads](http://www.spongecell.com/gallery) to see other examples of Spongecell's work.
