description: An in-progress game concept design following the interstellar Veda mission to colonize our nearest habitable planet.
---
Veda was conceptualized during my M.A. Interactive Game Design study at the Savannah College of Art and Design. It's currently in concept phase.

The player is a member of one of Earth's first other-planet colonization mission, called Veda.  The game begins with your protagonist, a 15-year-old female, who has been raised entirely on the century-long Veda mission spaceship.
