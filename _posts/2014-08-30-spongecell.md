At [Spongecell](http://www.spongecell.com), I've had daily client-facing interactions with exciting companies, brands, and agencies, both big and small.  I've been the lead producer on one of the company's largest clients, [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com), and have helped reimagine the production process and workflow, as well as redesign many of the creative assets. Other brands I've worked with on a quarterly basis include [Disney](http://www.disney.com), [Air New Zealand](http://www.airnewzealand.com), [GM](http://www.gm.com), [Scion](http://www.scion.com), and many others.

Other responsibilities include:

- producing ads via daily interaction with HTML5 and Flash CC
- direct client management and communication via email, phone, and in-person meetings
- collaboration with product, engineering, and sales teams
- project management via proprietary products, as well as tools like [Asana](http://www.asana.com) and [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
