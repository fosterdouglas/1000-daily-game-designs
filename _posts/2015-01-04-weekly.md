Weekly is a application to help streamline two-person workflow and scheduling. I created this to help navigate duos working remotely together, but in separate time zones. The most important thing we wanted to know was which sections of the day the other person was busy or availabile.  This interface lets us see that quickly, and create "linked" times with each other when we can by in sync.  The app is still currently being finished.
