Veda is an in-progress game concept design following an interstellar mission to colonize Earth's nearest habitable planet.  It was conceptualized during my Interactive Game Design study at Savannah College of Art and Design.

The player is a member of Earth's first other-planet colonization mission, called Veda.  The game begins with the protagonist, a 15-year-old female, who has been raised entirely on the century-long Veda mission spaceship.
