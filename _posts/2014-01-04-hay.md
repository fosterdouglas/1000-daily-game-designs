Hay is the first game that [Kevin](http://kevinmcgillivray.net "Kevin McGillivray")and I developed from the ideas in my Daily Game Designs blog.  At its core, it's based around the general strategies of chess, with a bit more flair.  It's designed to be lighthearted and simple, while retaining strategic depth. Below is the game in a very early stage of development:
