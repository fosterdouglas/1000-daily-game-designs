CodeConvoy was a web development school run by myself and [Kevin McGillivray](http://kevinmcgillivray.net "Kevin McGillivray").  My role was as lead designer and program consultant, while Kevin was head of curriculum content and teaching.  It was in session between 2015 and 2016, and its popularity and success has led to it currently being expanded and rebranded.  The website is still live and more details about the classes and general mission can be seen there:
