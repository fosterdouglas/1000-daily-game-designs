category: projects
---
This showcase is a collection of some of the 3D design completed during my Master's study at Savannah College of Art and Design.  I was asked to work in a variety of different 3D environments, including Unreal, Maya, and Cinema 4D.  This reel showcases a variety of those projects, completed between 2012 and 2013, compiled by me and scored by myself and [Felix Sofia Music](http://felixsofia.bandcamp.com "Felix Sofia Music").
