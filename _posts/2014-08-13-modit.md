I spent three months with Modit, designing and iterating countless versions of what would eventually become their new web platform.  The old design was clunky, outdated, and designed by programmers; I was tasked with creating something clean, simple, and modifiable. 

The images below are taken from a few of the projects I spearheaded during my time with Modit. The first image is a mock of a Gallery View, the next two images are a mock of a Product Page, and the last two are final designs for a crossword tool that was being made as a test game for the Modit platform.
