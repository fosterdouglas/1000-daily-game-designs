I was asked to work in a variety of different 3D environments during my study at Savannah College of Art and Design, including Unreal, Maya, and Cinema 4D.

This reel showcases a variety of those projects, completed between 2012 and 2013, and scored by myself and my now-defunct company, Felix Sofia Music.

Among the clips in the reel you'll see these projects:

Generic Crate Company (created in Unreal 3)  
The Lonely Fields (created in Cinema 4D)  
Bridge Cabin Shed Cave (created using Maya and Unreal 3)  
NGAB (created in Cinema 4D and Premiere Pro)
