description: An interactive storytelling game about a farmer and an alien invasion; made for the iPad.
---
Created with a team of five in the confines of an "interactive storytelling" class, Udder Invasion tells the tale of an unlikely farmer who inadvertently aids an alien invasion. I was responsible for gameplay concepts, the interface design, motion graphics, and a small amount of coding and debugging. (Other team members: Corey Zanotti, Wyatt Gallagher, Kelsi Reel, and Neil Short.)

Although the game wasn't submitted to the iOS App Store, a video of it being played can be seen below.
