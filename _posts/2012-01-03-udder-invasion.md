An interactive storytelling game for iPad, featuring a farmer and an alien invasion.  Created with a team of five in an interactive storytelling  class, Udder Invasion is a tale of an unlikely farmer who inadvertently aids an alien invasion. I was responsible for gameplay concepts, the interface design, motion graphics, and a small amount of coding and debugging.

Although the game wasn't submitted to the iOS App Store, a video of it being played can be seen below:
