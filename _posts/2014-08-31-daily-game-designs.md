description: My quest to create one interactive design, experience, game, or concepts per day for 1000 days.
---
On the first day of 2015, I began an epic quest to design and share one idea each day.  The ideas are focused around interactivity and games, but also branch out into UI/UX design, opinion pieces, and product design.

My goal is to do at least 1000.
