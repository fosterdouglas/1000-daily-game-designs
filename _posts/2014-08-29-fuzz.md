description: Guide your delicate but determined piece of fuzz through a throwback 8-bit adventure, solving puzzles and avoiding trecherous vacuum cleaners along the way.

As an exploration of the game design process, I created Fuzz in collaboration with [Corey Martin Zanotti](http://http://coreyzanotti.com "Corey Martin Zanotti") and [Kevin McGillivray](http://kevinmcgillivray.net "Kevin McGillivray"). It was a 6-month project that we worked around 5 hours per week on.

I made Fuzz to explore my ability to direct a game from start to finish, while working closely with team members. I learned a lot about process, structure, documentation, and bug fixing. It was also an awesome opportunity to collaborate with some of my favourite creative minds.

Fuzz is a simplistic top-down puzzle and adventure game. All animations, sprites, sound design, and level designs were created by myself; music by Kevin, with assistance by myself; all coding was done by Corey, also with assistance by me.
