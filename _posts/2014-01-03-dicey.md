Dicey is another collaboration project between [Kevin](http://kevinmcgillivray.net "Kevin McGillivray") and I.  It's a simple speed-counting game, based on education-forward game design, and gamification.  Although it's unfinished, below you can see some images from it and play its current iteration:
