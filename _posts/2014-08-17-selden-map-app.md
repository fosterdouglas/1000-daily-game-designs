The Selden Map iPad App is an interactive exploration of a Chinese trading map from the Ming Dynasty. The map has been sitting at Oxford for over 400 years without much attention. In 2010, Dr. Robert Batchelor of Georgia Southern University discovered faint sea routes marked onto the map. This has sparked renewed interest in the map, and led to a restoration in 2011.

We began the project with an analysis of the existing technologies to build the app. I was responsible for the initial design concepts while [Corey Martin Zanotti](http://http://coreyzanotti.com "Corey Martin Zanotti") laid out the software architecture to create the app. We worked back and forth, refining the information architecture and adding new features to the app.
