_Guide a delicate piece of fuzz through an 8-bit adventure, solving puzzles and avoiding treacherous vacuum cleaners along the way!_

As my first exploration of the game design process, I created Fuzz in collaboration with [Corey Martin Zanotti](http://http://coreyzanotti.com "Corey Martin Zanotti") and [Kevin McGillivray](http://kevinmcgillivray.net "Kevin McGillivray") over a 6-month period.

I made Fuzz to explore my ability to direct a game from start to finish, while working closely with others on process, structure, documentation, and bug fixing.

Fuzz is a simplistic top-down puzzle and adventure game. Animations, sprites, sound design, and level designs were created by myself; coding was done by Corey, with some assistance by myself; music by Kevin, also with assistance by me.
