title:  Selden Map App

The Selden Map iPad App is an educational and interactive exploration of a Chinese trading map from the Ming Dynasty. The map has been sitting at Oxford for over 400 years without much attention, until 2010 when Dr. Robert Batchelor of Georgia Southern University discovered faint sea routes marked onto the map. This has sparked renewed interest in the map, and led to its restoration in 2011.

I was responsible for the initial interface design concepts while [Corey Martin Zanotti](http://http://coreyzanotti.com "Corey Martin Zanotti") laid out the software architecture to create the app. We worked back and forth, refining the information architecture and adding new features to the app.
