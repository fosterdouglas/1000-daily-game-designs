A life-sized projection installation against wooden canvas that explores body and form, created using custom-made generative software.  Angel takes images of seventeen past Victoria's Secret "Angels" to create a life-size projection against a wooden canvas. Custom generative software pixelates the portrait of each model into an animated collage. Each moment, every pixel is fading from one of the seventeen images to another, creating an abstract but distinct image of a body. This new body is formed through the collection of the bodies, as Angel attempts to reveal our undeniable addiction and attraction to the bare skin.

A special thanks to [Nathaniel Stern](http://nathanielstern.com "Nathaniel Stern") and [Kevin McGillivray](http://kevinmcgillivray.net "Kevin McGillivray"). A video capture of the software's output (but not of the piece's actual installation) can be seen below.
