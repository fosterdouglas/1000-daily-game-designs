This video was designed to bring more emotion and modernism into the Red Cross branding.  The campaign was focused on informing people about the number of lives they can save through the simple act of giving blood.

Copywriting, typography, and design are by me; the video clips are from [Mont Blanc](http://www.montblanconesecond.com "Mont Blanc") and used with permission. [Dave Myatt](http://www.mediamessage.co.uk "Dave Myatt") generously provided the voice work.
