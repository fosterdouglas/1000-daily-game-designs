Below are examples of some of my design work on our websites and clients at [Sandcastle](http://sandcastle.co "Sandcastle").  Each example features of time-lapse video of some images and media from throughout the design process.  All websites were built, coded, and design-supported by [Kevin McGillivray](http://www.kevinmcgillivray.net "Kevin McGillivray").

Our design for Kat Boogaard's freelance writing website was focused on creating a bright and exciting design experience.  During the design process, the layout and interactions came together quickly, while the fonts and colors took various stages of iteration.  After the website was built, Kat commissioned us to update her logo and general branding, as well.

<h2 style="font-color:#3897C1";>UntitledTown Book & Author Festival</h2>

Kevin and I donted our time and services to this project, a first-year literary event happening in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  We worked closely with the board members of the event to define and refine an entire visual style of the 3-day event, and then applied that visual design to a custom from-scratch website.

<h2 style="font-color:#EDC336";>Foster Douglas Personal Website</h2>

My personal website has gone through a ridiculous number of visual iterations, finally recently landing comfortably on the current iteration. The project is a good example of how I've grown as a designer, and how important it is to sometimes revisit and update past designs.
