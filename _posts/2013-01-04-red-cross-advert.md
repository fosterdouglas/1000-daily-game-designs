This 30-second typographic treatment for the American Red Cross was designed to bring more emotion and modernism into the company's branding.  The campaign's goal was to inform people about the number of lives they can save through the simple act of giving blood.

Copywriting, typography, and design are by me; the video clips are from [Mont Blanc](http://www.montblanconesecond.com "Mont Blanc") and used with permission. [Dave Myatt](http://www.mediamessage.co.uk "Dave Myatt") generously provided the voice work.
