description: "A single-player remixed take on the classic card game Magic: The Gathering."

After moving to San Francisco without many established connections, I found myself questioning the usefulness of my stacks upon stacks of _Magic: The Gathering_ cards. This led me to design a variant to the original game that only requires a single person.

The game requires a standard sized MTG deck, as well as one additional card, which could be downloaded and printed, or displayed on one's phone. The additional card acts as the "boss" and the player uses their deck to defeat it.

Many of the rules for this variant are still being finalized, as it's currently in a beta state.
