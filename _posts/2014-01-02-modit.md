I spent three months with [Modit](https://mod.it/ "Modit") (now defunct), designing and iterating countless versions of what eventually became their web platform.  The old design was clunky, outdated, and designed hastily by the programmers; I was tasked with creating something clean, simple, and modifiable. I spent the majority of my time on wireframes, visual mocks, and interface designs.  The images below are taken from a few of the projects I worked on:
